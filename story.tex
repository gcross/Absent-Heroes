%@+node:gcross.20081101122204.3:Christina forgets her lockpick
The guard leaned casually next to the door, chewing nicotine free tobacco.  “You know Marv,” he grumbled.  “It seems like we spend all of our lives alternating between standing here conscious but bored, or unconscious after some hero arrives and knocks us out.  Ever feel like we were meant for something more than this?”

The other guard started to reply, but then he immediately alternated to the latter of the two states as Christina gave him a quick kick to the head.

``Dammit,'' shrieked Marv as he attempted to quickly draw his sword.  ``Not ag--''  He didn’t get to finish his sentence, but dropped to the floor instead.

Christina fished around Marv’s pocket for the key to the door, and let herself in.  She may have had a universal lock-pick on her, but there was always a certain satisfaction to using a key you had won for yourself.

She entered and found herself inside a chamber.  The door slammed close behind her as a voice boomed, ``You must now prove that you are the Master by solving a crossword puzzle of such difficulty that only the genius of the Master himself could pass.  Fail, and your body shall be reduced to ashes.''  A set of squares faded on the wall to her left, and writing appeared on the wall to her right.  She walked up to the writing and read through it.  It would require someone with encyclopedic knowledge to figure it out.

Happily, she had just re-memorized the encyclopedia that morning.

``You have thirty minutes to complete the puzzle,'' the voice boomed.  Christina shook her head;  the Puzzle Master couldn’t possibly be as smart as he thought he was if it really took him a whole thirty minutes to solve his own puzzle.  She walked to the other side of the chamber, saying a silent prayer for the piles of ashes that lay next to it, picked up the chisel and hammer, and systematically completed the puzzle in less than ten minutes.

``Welcome, Master!''  the voice boomed as both doors opened.  She smiled with satisfaction as she walked through and entered the treasury.

A large vault stood before her;  on the inside of this vault lay all the treasure which the Puzzle Master had accumulated from several years of pillaging.  All she had to do now was open the door, load it into her weightless infinite bag of holding, and return home.

She smiled.  This was almost too easy.  She reached into her left pocket for her universal lock-pick.

It wasn’t there.

``Oops, I can never remember which pocket I put that thing in,'' she thought to herself as she reached into her right pocket.

It wasn’t there, either.

She cursed, quickly fumbling through the rest of her pockets.  She then had a vision of the lock-pick sitting on her desk as she left her home a week ago...

Oh god, not again.

She screamed and kicked at the door a few times just to see it would bulge.  Her foot hurt now, and her morale hadn’t improved.  In a deep funk, she started to make her way out of the fortress.

Marv had regained consciousness by now, and was rubbing his temple as she left the Puzzle Chamber.  ``Wait, did you really just come all this way, simply to forget you lock pick and get stuck?''  He looked at her, and started to laugh, ``Oh, now I recognize you.  You’re Christina, aren’t you?  Man, I’ve heard stories, but to actually see how stu--'' His laughter came to an abrupt end as his body slammed into the wall.

She glared at the other guard.  “Do you have anything to say?”

His face paled.  Unlike Marv, he had also heard the stories of her legendary temper.  Mollified, he asked  ``Umm, Miss, if you’re leaving anyway, could we please have our key back?  The Master gets really mad at us when we lose it...''

She rolled her eyes, and threw the key at him.  It knocked him in the forehead and he was down again.

She sulked as she made her way out of the fortress.  Unfortunately, nobody else was stupid enough to mock or harass her on the way out, so she didn’t get any other opportunities to take out her frustration on someone.

Her horse was waiting for her outside.  She got on it and started making her way back to the village.  She grimaced in anticipation of what was to come.

%@+node:gcross.20081101122204.6:A unwelcome waiting committee
At least the crowd awaiting her return this time was a little smaller than usual, but it was still there.  As she entered the town, they started cheering, ``Hooray!  She has returned victorious from the Puzzle Master!''    They were half right, but only half.  They quieted as she made her way to the center of the town, where a platform had been set up for her to make a speech.  They waited for her to mount it, but instead she just kept riding past.

Some caught on right away, but others were confused.  ``Why is she not making a speech proclaiming her victory?'' they asked themselves, as she made her way to the town inn.  ``Could it be...''

She parked her horse in the stables and went up to her room.  She quickly packed up the remainder of her things for travelling, gave the last of her money to the innkeeper to pay for her stay, and made her way to the exit.  On her way out, a child eagerly shouted, ``How much treasure did you get from him?'' before his mom hushed him up and gave Christina a look of sympathy.  Christina shook her head, and started making her way out of town.

Thankfully, most of the crowd had dispersed by this time, though the podium remained as a monument to her failure.  One man was waiting by the gate for her, and jeered as she rode by. ``You damn heroes have been taking our money for years to support your adventures, and now that you finally get around to taking care of us you accomplish absolutely nothing!''  She just hung her head as she made her way out.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.2:At the bar
Christina started on the long ride home.  Unfortunately, she didn't have any money to pay for inns or food;  she had been given only enough to get her to the Puzzle Master, under the assumption that she would be able to use the treasure she got from the castle to fund her way back.  It thus took her twice as long to return home as it had for her to make it out here, since she had to take time to hunt and gather to feed herself, and to set up camp and night.  She was good at these things, but this time she took no pleasure in them.

After two weeks of (unfortunately) uneventful travelling, she finally made it back to her home town.  There was enough daylight left that she had enough time to drop off her stuff at her room in the barracks, return her horse to the stables, and make her way to the town pub.  She needed to get drunk as quickly as possible, and decided that was worth taking the risk that people would actually see her.

Happily, the place was not packed.  She sat down at the bar.  The bartender walked over to her with a look of concern, but Christina just told her, ``I want a pan-galactic gargle blaster.  No; on second thought, make that a double.''

As Christina nursed her drink, she started to look over the other faces at the pub.  She was hoping to see her close friend Homer, but he was not here.  She took a big swallow, and then looked up.  A man was staring a her;  a very handsome one.  She locked eyes with him, and her heart leapt.  Could it be... was this the one?

He started to make his way towards her, his eyes locked into hers, and it was clear that they were both thinking the same thing.

She nerviously brushed through her hair to fix herself up.  People were always trying to convince her that there was no such thing as ``love at first sight,'' but here she was experiencing it at last!

She continued to stare into his eyes as he approached, and she started to greet him... as he walked straight past her and started talking to the girl behind her.  ``Your eyes... I have never seen anything like them,''  Christina watched him tell the girl, as they gazed at each other, completely oblivious to anything else.  He took her hand and kissed it.  ``It is warm in here.  Would you care to take a walk outside with me to cool off?''  ``I would love to,'' she replied, smiling.  He took her arm, and they left the pub.

Christina slumped.  Not again, she thought to herself.  I mean, honestly, what were the odds that this would happen to her five times in a row?  Was she really naive to think that the guy was actually staring into her eyes, this time?

She felt an arm wrap around her.  ``Hey buddy,'' a man said to her.  ``I saw what happened.  You really have the worst luck with these things.''

She gave Homer a smile -- small, but warm -- as she pressed herself against him for a moment.  The two of them had started their hero training together, and had developed a close friendship over the years.  ``This really isn't my day;  or my month, for that matter,'' she told him.

Homer looked at her with concern.  ``What happened this time?''

``So, I made it all the way into his fortress --- and really, you should have seen me!  He had no less than seven gangs of ninjas waiting for me, each versed in a different martial arts style in the hope that one of them would be able to take me down.  Of course, in his arrogance he gave them nearly all of the keys to his castle so as I took each one down it was easy as pie to make my way around.  And his puzzle chambers... I mean, honestly, who \emph{couldn't} solve the differential equation $dz=\frac{1}{3}x^2\,dx+\frac{1}{3}y^2\,dy$ in their head?  It's basic integration!  And, god, he keeps re-using so many of his crossword clues that I stopped having to even think about half of them...''

``And then,''  Homer asked?

``And then I realized that I had forgotten the stupid lock-pick that I needed to get into his vault.  Honestly, I feel so stupid...''

``You're not stupid, Christina, just a little absent minded is all.''  He took a deep breath.  ``You know, I really didn't want to bring this up, but maybe it is time that you thought about whether this is really the right line of work for you...''

She glared at him.  ``You're right, that is a very bad point for you to bring up.''

Homer continued.  ``Seriously though, Christina.  You are good at so many things.  You fight like a human tornado and you absorb and regurgitate knowledge like a master scholar.  But to be a hero requires more than these things;  you need to have the ability to get \emph{all} of the details right, not merely most of them, and if you can't do that then you are just being a danger to yourself.  There is a reason, after all, that are not allowed to have partners anymore.''

She flushed and pulled away from him.  ``I choose not to have partners because they keep slowing me down and getting in my way!  How can I help if they keep putting themselves in front of my leg when I am in the middle of kicking people?'

``They were trying to help you...''

``Well maybe I don't need any help!'' she shouted at him.  Then she relaxed and slouched.  ``Sorry, I know that you are just trying to help.''

``No, the fault is mine;  I shouldn't have brought it up.  Here, I'll buy you a drink to make it up to you,'' Homer graciously conceded.

She smiled at him.  ``Oh, stop it, you know that I was being unreasonable and are just too nice to say it.  You really treat me too well, you know that?''

He returned the smile.  ``Hey, what other hero can I go picking up guys with?  Oops, another sore point,'' he said as she slouched again.

``Why do the guys always go for the girl next to me, Homer?  Am I really so ugly?''

Homer sighed.  ``Of course not, Christina.  Perhaps it's just that you can come across as being a little, well, intimidating at times?''

``I AM NOT INTIMIDATING!''  she shouted as she slammed her hand onto the bar.  Unfortunately, the hand did not stop at the bar, but made its way all the way through as the bar was split into two pieces.

Homer tried to avoid laughing as Christina blushed.  She sheepishly muttered, ``You know, maybe there is such a thing as doing too many wood breaking drills...  I really need to get myself out of the habit of doing this.''

The bartender walked over and shook his head.  ``I guess I'll be billing this to the Order as well?''

Just what I needed, Christina thought to herself, something else for the boss to chew me out over.  ``Yes,'' she replied.

Homer stood and patted Christina on the back.  ``I think that it's time for us to be going home.''

She sighed, stood, and followed him out the door.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.3:Homer walks her home
Since Homer and Christina lived in the same barracks, they walked home together.  Homer's room was before Christina's in the hallway, but he walked past it to escort her to her door.  She appreciated the gesture, but was embarassed when she opened her door.  I don't just fight like a tornado, she thought to herself, I live like one too.

Homer looked at the mess inside, and then at Christina inquisitively.  ``I was a little hurried packing to leave, so I tore my room apart.''

He smiled, kindly. ``Well then, let's put it back together.''

``Aww, that really isn't neccessary...'' Christina started to protest.  Homer raised his hand.  ``What are friends for?  You've helped me deal with worse, after all,'' he replied entering the room.

She smiled and followed him inside.  They proceeded to pick up the items scattered across the floor and put them away.  Homer picked up a bag on the floor and asked her,  ``Tell me you didn't leave your infinite bag of holding here as well while you were out adventuring?''

She laughed, ``No, thankfully, at least I remembered that.  What you're holding is actually just a bag that I use for shopping that's decorated to look like it.  I would love to use my infinite bag of holding all of the time, but unfortunately as you know it can only hold treasure and not practical items like armor or anything else I'd actually want to buy.  Of course, most of the merchants don't know that so they just assume that I am there to buy a whole lot and give me very good service while I am there.''

``You still buy your own armor?'' Homer asked as he put the bag away in the top drawer.  ``I thought that the Order had just finished redesigning it so that it can fit women now.''

``It's true that the new armor is finally, shall we say, `anatomically correct', but it still lacks style, and if you can't have a little style then what's the point of being a hero?''

``Point,'' Homer chuckled, and the two of them continued to chat the time away as they brought the room back to a state of order.

``Thank you so much for taking care of me tonight, Homer,''  Christina told him warmly as he left the room.

``My pleasure,'' he replied, turning to face her while standing in the doorway.  ``Heck, it is the least I can do after you spent an entire month taking care of me after my ex dumped me.''

She ran up to him and gave him a hug, and then they both went to bed.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.10:Christina walks to meet the boss (Background on the Order)
Christina was not looking forward to meeting her boss, Bill, that morning.

The campus was designed so that the dormitories were on the opposite side from the main hall, where the briefings and other business occured.  There was a reason for this;  it meant that every time a hero walked from the drom to the hall, he or she had to pass through the memorial ground in the center of the campus, and nobody could walk through this ground without being moved and inspired.

The most prominent memorial was the great statue in the middle of the ground of Patrick Smith, the man who lead the First Heroes in overthrowing King George, the infamous last of the kings who had decided that oppressing his subjects was simply more `fun' than serving them.  This, however, was not why he was honored, for many heros had defeated great enemies, but no other had their statue in this ground.  What made Patrick special was that after leading the First Heroes to overthrow the King, in the moment when the people had been willing to crown him their ruler in their stead, he refused the honor and instead created a parliamentary democracy to govern the land.  He and the First Heroes together founded the Order of Heroes, and by his insistence it was deliberately made subservient to the parliament;  on the platform below his statue is carved the calling of the Heroes of the Order:  ``We fight to protect, not to rule.''  His figure is protrayed on one knee, with a sword held high in one hand and a child cradled against him in the other.

If anyone had doubt in the commitment of the Order in carrying out its mission over the last three hundred years, it would be immediately dispelled by the plain stones surrounding the statue -- stones filled with names, hundreds of names, of the heroes who had died in service.  Every time Christina walked past the stones, she would reach out and touch some of the names.  No woman's name appeared on the stones, and in a way she was glad of this;  since she had been the first woman admitted to the order, if a name were to appear on the stones in the near future it would be her own!

She continued quietly on her way to her commander's office, sobered both by the memorial ground and also by thoughts of the briefing she was going to have to give him shortly.

%@+node:gcross.20081108185724.7:Take 2:  The Expositionary Monument
Christina was not looking forward to meeting her boss, Bill, that morning.  However, her thoughts on this were interrupted as she approached the monument.

In order to give the heros a daily reminder of what the order stood for, there was a memorial ground in between the barracks and the main office, forcing them to walk through it on the way to do business.  In the middle of the ground stood a statue dedicated to Patrick Smith the Great, the founder of the Order.  This alone would have been enough make him worthy of honor, but the full story was even more inspiring

Patrick had lead the First Heros to overthrow the last of the kings, King George, after the former king had decided that oppressing and terrorizing his people was more fun than protecting them.  After he had won, the people wanted to crown him king in replacement, but Patrick refused.  Instead, he lead an effort to build a new institution to govern in the place of the king, a parliament filled by respresentatives elected by the people.  Rather than giving the Order power in the government, he founded it as a servent of the body, ready to be called upon to protect the people.

Of course, democracies are messy things.  The First Parliament did a horrible job of governing, even if it was a little better than many of the worst kings, and many people why he was supporting such an organization and did not move to take control himself.  He replied, ``I know that this system of government is imperfect, but no system will be perfect and this will be better on average than any other.''  Then someone asked, ``But why keep it, when you could have the chance to take over and be a perfect ruler?''  He laughed, and replied, ``I am hardly perfect, there is no such thing as perfect in this world, and it would be a fool's errand to sacrifice the good in a vain attempt to attain it.''  He then continued to speak his most famous words, which were carved on the side of the podium underneath his statue:

\begin{center}
\textsc{We fight for the good, not for the perfect.}
\end{center}

There were certainly many times after Patrick's death when the Order had been tempted to take matters into its own hands, but they had so much respect for his honor and wisdom that they kept to his words and never allowed themselves to break the government in order to save it.  This may seem like a silly worry now when these institutions are so deeply rooted, but at the time they had just emerged from an era of Might makes Right and so it was very difficult to restrain when one had the power to force one's way.  But they did, and the world was a better place for it.

And in case this was not enough, the statue itself gave further reminder to the meaning of the hero's call.  Unsurprisingly, in Patrick's right hand was a sword held high;  but in his right hand, he held a child close to him, adding emotional impact to the words carved on the opposite site,

``Never forget who it is that you serve, and why.''

Since all who passed this memorial were exposed to the meaning of the Order and its history, it was often called the ``Expositionary Memorial.''

As Christina started walking away from it, her thoughts turned back to the present.  She was not looking forward to what her commander, Bill, would have to say to her.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.4:Meeting with the boss
As expected, her commander, Bill, was less than pleased.

``So let me get this straight... you made it all the way into the vault -- something that has eluded many of our best heros and reduced them into ashes -- and then you couldn't go in because you forgot your lock-pick.''

Christina just sat in silence, her head hung low.

Bill shook his head.  ``Listen, Christina, the people don't pay us to go adventuring just for the fun of it!  We are paid to right wrongs, to return the money that was plundered to them by villains.  I don't know how much longer we can support you if you keep this up.''

Shock entered Christina's face.  She was aware of how disappointed Bill had been of her, but this was the first time he brought up firing her.  She looked up,  ``Give me another chance, Bill, I swear to you that this time I will get it right.''

``Happily, as it turns out,'' Bill replied, reaching into his desk, ``I do have another mission for you.  It's a tough one, though, but quite frankly if you can't do it, then nobody can.''

Christina perked up.  ``Thank you for having faith in me, Bill!''

Bill snorted.  ``I am not saying that I think you will be able to pull this off, just that if you can't then it is unlikely that anybody else could have.  For all of your forgetfullness and inability to actually complete missions, you are still the smartest, toughest, and fastest hero we have on the rolls.  And so even though I don't think that you will succeed, I would hate to see us not even try and at least I can be reasonabily confident that you won't get your soul eaten.''

Christina's eyes widened.  ``You don't mean...''

``Yes, Christina, I do.  Although the Soul Eater's magic is powerful enough to let him keep his lair outside this world most of the time, even he cannot prevent it from surfacing from time to time, and our wizards have calculated that it will surface in the middle of the ocean again three days from now, and remain here for twenty-four hours before returning to the Aether.''

``Three days?  That isn't nearly enough time...''

``We have hired the service of a dragoneer to drop you off just at the start of the twenty-four hour window and to pick you up at the end.  That might not seem like a lot of time, but happily the Soul Eater, like every other villain, is in some respects his own worst enemy.  He believes that no one would dare to actually infiltrate his lair during this window, so he has not put up as many traps as you are used to having to deal with --- at least, that is what our latest intelligence is on the subject.''

``How recent is that intelligence?''  Christina asked.

``One hundred years old, dating from the last time he surfaced,''  Bill answered.  ``Should I bother asking you whether you are up for this mission?''

Christina slammed her hand against the desk and declared, ``Of course I am up for it!  The dangers might be great, but the glory shall be greater still -- the infamous Soul Eater is about to meet his match!  And, oh, sorry about your desk...''  she finished sheepily, brushing small pieces of wood from her hand.'

``It's okay,'' Bill sighed, staring at the two pieces of wood where his desk had been.  ``I have finally learned by now to never have a meeting with you using my `good desk', so this was a cheap one made soley for this occasion.''  He turned his eyes towards her and looked sharply.  ``But though we may be well funded, it's not like Order is made of money, Christina.  You would do well to remember that.''

A new man entered the room.  He smiled at Christina.  ``Oh, hey, great to see you again!  How did my universal lock pick work?  Were you able to use it to enter the vault?  I spent a lot of time working on that one.''

``No need to talk about that just now, Marcus, '' Bill replied gruffly.  ``It suffices to say that the adaquateness of your lock-pick was not responsible for the failure of her mission.  Why don't you take her down to the lab to show her the new gadgets you have enchanted for her next mission.''

``Oh, the mision failed?  What happened?  Was it the sleeping pills I gave you?  I tested them on our lab dragon to make sure that the spell was strong enough.  Believe me, he was not to happy about...''

``Marcus!''  Bill shouted.

``Oh, right sir.  Well, let's get going then,'' he said to Christina.  She stood and followed him down to his lab.

``You'll love what we have for you this time!'' Marcus told Christina with excitement as they made their to the lab.

Despite being in a horrible mood, Christina couldn't help but smile.  Marcus's enthusiasm never cease to be infectious.

``This mission you are going on had some unusual challenges for us, but happily we solved every one of them!  Ah, here we go,'' he said, as they entered the lab.

Christina gasped.  A large, beautiful cloth stretched before her, with ropes handing from four of the corners.

Marcus grinned at her reaction.  ``Do you like it?  We call it a `fall-breaker'.  The cloth was woven to be very, very light, but thick enough that it actually will trap air under it and allow you to glide to the ground after you jump off the dragon.''

Surprised, Christina asked,  ``I am jumping off the dragon?''

``Oh, Bill hadn't told you that part yet?  Yes, unfortunately the dragon is going to be very spooked by the island and so it won't be able to land you there.  It will bring you in pretty close, and then you will jump off wearing the fall-breaker and glide down to the island.''

``There is no way you are testing that thing on me!''

``Don't worry Christina, it has already been tested.  I jumped off the top of the town clock tower a couple of times with it myself, and the second time I didn't even break any bones!  But enough about the fall-breaker.  You might now be wondering how it is that you are going to get off the island if the dragon will not be landing to pick you up.''

Christina choked.  ``Actually, it hadn't even occured to me to worry about that until you mentioned it.''

Marcus beamed.  ``That is exactly why you should be glad to have genuiuses like us thinking about these things for you!  Look, see this ball here,'' he said, picking up a small ball with a rope attached to it, and holding it before her.  ``Just squeeze this three times, and it will inflate to become gigantic,'' he said.  He squeezed the ball, and as promised it grew until it was larger than Marcus.  It started to float to the ceiling, and he held onto the rope and allowed it to lift him.  ``See?  We call this a `float ball', and it will let you fly back up to the dragon when you are finished!  Umm... except we haven't worked out how to make it gently deflate it yet, so could you catch me when I let go of the rope.''

Christina couldn't help laughing.  ``Of course, Marcus,'' she replied.  She held out her arms and caught him as he returned to the ground.

``Thank you!'' Marcus said, regaining his composure.  ``But this isn't all we have for you.  Now, what is the most annoying problem that heros have after they have defeated their villain?''

Christina was embarassed to reply, ``I actually don't have much practical experience with that, so...''

``Convincing him to order his minions to load up your infinite bag of holding with his treasure!  After all, there is usually so much of it that it would take at least a day to load it all yourself.  Add in the fact that the Death Eater is a creature of the Aether making him very difficult to hurt directly, and it would normally be impossible to convince him to do anything at all for you.''  He paused for dramatic effect.

Christina smiled, and asked, ``But?''

``But since he is made of the ether, we can actually \emph{force} him to work for us by touching him with this stone,'' he answered with enthusiasm, holding a glowing red sphere the size of his palm.  ``This was actually a pet project of mine that I have been working on in my spare time for the last few years;  I never thought I'd get the chance to actually see it in use!''

Christina knew better than to ask, but nervousness got the better of her.  ``And you are sure this works?''

``Of course!  We summoned several spirits of varying strengths and sizes to test it and it worked on all them.''

Christina thought for a moment.  ``Could you mount it on a staff for me?''

``Certainly!  We'll call it your Sceptre of Power,''  Marcus beamed.  ``Anyway, this is all we have for you for his mission.  Here are the operating instructions for all of them,'' he said, handing her several rolls of parchment.  ``And the two rolls on the bottom contain all the details of the mission.''

``Thank you,'' Christina replied sincerely as she took the scrolls.  ``I need to start reading through all this right now, since I will be leaving really soon.''

``Of course.  Let us know how everyone worked!''

``Will do, Marcus,''  Christina said to him as she left the room.

The flight to the island was going to take two days, so Christina had only a single day to get herself ready for the mission.  She started by reading through all of the scrolls several times to make sure she understood how to use the new equipment.  To make sure she was comfortable using it, she managed to get her hands on extras that she spent a couple of hours training with.  She was surprised at how manueverable the `fall-breaker' was;  by tugging on the left and right ropes, she could accurately steer herself to a particular spot on the ground;  just in case, though, she first borrowed many, many bales of hay and set them up over a wide area.

As she was practicing, she could hear the sounds of a crowd cheering in the distance.  It spurned her to work harder to prepare -- pretty soon, that would be \emph{her} crowd cheering her own triumphant return!

Eventually she felt comfortable with everything.  The day was almost done, so she made a list of everything she needed and carefully went through it as she packed everything up.  She really wanted to tell Homer where she was going, but he was away that night, so she instead made sure she got an early night's sleep.

The next morning, Christina woke up, picked up her things, and started making her way to the dragonport.  As she opened the door to go outside the barracks, she was greeted by the sight of a massive crowd which suddenly burst into cheering.

A tear crossed her eye.  She had heard of heroes who were successful and so loved that they had crowds who actually cheered their departure as well as their arrival, but she had never believed that there would ever be a crowd cheering her on!  She opened her mouth and started to say something as she felt a hand on her shoulder.  ``Pardon me, Christina, but you are blocking the door.''  Then Christina realized something: it was not her name that the crowd was cheering.

``Ba-rack!  Ba-rack! Ba-rack!'' they all shouted as Barack edged her way past her and walked down to the crowd.  Christina watched as they followed him away from the barracks.  The tear was still in her eye, but for a different reason now.

She clenched her fists.  ``Pretty soon, they \emph{will} be cheering for me!''  She started making her way down to the dragonport, in the process running through her mental list of things to bring.  `Fall-breaker'... check.  Float ball... check.  Sceptre of Power... check.  Universal lock-pick... check.  Raw meat for the crocadiles... check.  Infinite bag of holding... oops!  She mentally kicked herself:  how could she have forgotten \emph{that}?  She ran back to her room, opened her top drawer and grabbed her bag, and headed back out.

As she made her way to the dragonport, she saw a crowd waiting there for here.  So she did have fans!  She started to grin, until she saw the signs.

STOP BURNING OUR MONEY TO FUND YOUR ADVENTURES!

MAKE PEACE WITH OUR ENEMIES, NOT WAR!

THE `ORDER' ONLY BRINGS CHAOS!

Oh, god, why was she always the one who drew the pacifists?  She pushed her way through them and made her way to the dragon.  She head someone shout,  ``It is no wonder that our enemies pillage us with the way you heros treat them!''

Christina fumed.  She turned to face the crowd, and shouted ``Do you have any idea who it is I am about to fight?  No one less than the Soul Eater himself!  Do you know what he does?  He comes to the Earth and not only steals their money, but eats their living souls!''

``Maybe he would stop picking on us if you heros stopped bothering him!''

Christina groaned.  ``We haven't ever pulled off a successful attack on him...''

``Yeah, but you keep trying!''

``Yes, but keep in mind,''  Christina shouted back, ``that this is the SOUL EATER.  He needs to feed on souls in order to live.  Even if he stopped bothering us, he has \emph{farms} where he raises \emph{human beings} to feed his unearthly hunger!  The least we can do is cause him a little pain in return.''

``His internal affairs are not our problem!''

Christina flushed with rage, and was about to say more when the dragoneer called to her, ``Come on!  We barely have enough daylight to make it our next stop as it is.''  She took a deep breath, tuned around, and started to climb onto the dragon's back.

``Besides, how do we know that he even likes eating souls?''  someone shouted.  ``For all we know, he hates eating souls and just does it to live!  Does living according to his nature give us the right to attack him?''

``If it turns out that he gets a stomach ache every time he eats a soul, I will absolutely collapse into tears,'' replied Christina sarcastically;  many of the crowd laughed in response as the dragon took to flight.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.7:Flying; conversation with a dragon
As the dragon took off into the air, Christina marveled at the sight below her.  She was incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to travel this way;  dragons were so expensive that only the very rich could afford to use them.

A few moments later, she had a second revelation:  she absolutely hated flying!  It was like experiencing the discomfort of horse-riding and the sickness of sailing at the same time.  She closed her eyes in the hope that this would make it better, and when it failed to do so she unloaded her breakfast to the ground below.  She was grateful that at least the dragoneer hadn't seemed to notice, since the rush of wind at the speeds at which they were travelling made it impossible to hear anything.  She sighed, and held on.

Eight agonizing hours later, they arrived at their destination, the town of Leighover.  Flights very frequently made stops here, so there was a landing area prepared for the dragon, complete with several cows for snacks.  The dragon landed in the middle of a field, allowed the pilot and his passenger off, and then immediately started chowing down on the cows.  Christina and the dragoneer made their way to the inn, where Christina -- who was starving, as she was not able to eat anything while flying -- ate nearly as much as the dragon, and then collapsed into bed.  Who would have thought that flying could be so exhausting?

The next day was much the same;  she didn't feel as bad this time, though -- perhaps she was starting to get used to it.

They made it all the way to the coast.  To keep them as close as possible to the next day's destination, they had to land south from the closest major city, which meant that this night they would be camping.  They landed, and the dragon flew off to forage for the night's dinner, as the dragoneer and Christina prepared set up camp and prepared dinner for themselves from their packed supplies.

``I am surprised that you can trust it to return to us,''  Christina remarked to the dragoneer.  This was actually the first time that Christina had a chance to actually talk to the dragoneer;  in the air it was too noisy for more than the occasionally shouted update on their current progress, and the previous night she had been too famished and exhausted to have more than a token conversation with him.

``First of all, the dragon is not an `it';  his name is Arthur,'' the dragoneer replied.  ``Second, of course he will return!  If he doesn't take us to our destination, then he won't get paid.''

Christina was surprised by this information.  ``It... he... get's paid?''

``Of course he gets paid!  Do you think he would do this for free?''

Christina was not sure how to respond to this, so she replied, ``Well, umm, I didn't...''

The dragoneer shook his head.  ``I bet you though that Arthur was a pack animal, didn't you?''   He snorted.  ``Hmph!  Heroes -- so educated, and yet so ignorant.  So few people have interactions with dragons that they are often misunderstood, and rather than combatting this the Order actually encourages it by training its heros to think of dragons as nothing more than  large, blood-thirsty beasts.  After all, it wouldn't be suit them for you heros to give any second thought to killing them, now would it?''  The dragoneer took another bite of his meal, and then continued,  ``So, to answer your unspoken question, yes, Arthur is every bit as intelligence as you and I.  In fact, he is probably more intelligent, given that he is doing this passenger duty in order to pay for tuition for his doctoral program.''

``If dragons are so intelligent and scholarly, then why do they have an odd tendacy to end up as blood-thirsty guardians of the fortress of evil villains!''

The dragoneer shrugged.  ``Dragons are like people;  they aren't all alike.''

Christina pondered this for a moment, and then asked, ``What is Arthur studying?''

``Since you ask, he is going for his doctorate in Villain Studies,''  the dragoneer replied.  ``Part of the reason why he took this mission was because it would give him the chance to see an evil villain's lair close up -- though he is not stupid enough to actually want to \emph{land} on the island, since his soul would be in as much danger as yours.''  The pilot paused to take another bite.  ``Speaking of which, why on Earth are you going through with this mission, anyway?  It's not like we can do anything to actually hurt the Soul Eater.''

``Because doing something is better than nothing!'' Christina declared.

``Typical hero,'' the dragoneer replied, as he turned away to focus on his meal.

Christina wondered about what the pilot had told her.  She had killed a few dragons herself and hadn't had a second thought about it.  Were they really as intelligent as the pilot claimed?

As the sunlight died away, Arthur returned.  Christina saw him lift a sack from the cargo pouch.  He opened it, carefully remove a large book from it, and set it by the fire.  He then took out the largest pair of spectacles Christina had ever seen, put them on, and started read his book by the fire.

Well, I suppose that answers that question, she thought to herself.  ``Arthur?'' she asked him.  Arthur ignored her.  She whispered to the dragoneer, ``Can he talk?''

He snorted.  ``Of course he can talk!  Dragons could talk since before you and I were apes.  It's just that they tend to be very reticent, especially a scholarly bookwarm like Arthur.''

Christina tried a different approach.  If dragon academics were anything like human academics, they loved nothing more than to talk about what they knew.  So she asked, ``So, Arthur, what have you learned in your studies of villains?  Have you learned anything about the Soul Eater?''

This got Arthur's attention;  he placed his book on the ground and turned to look at her.  ``Many things I have learned,'' Arthur replied.  His voice was a very low bass, deep enough to for Christina to feel through her entire body, and at the same time so quiet that it was barely a whipser above the crackle of the fire.  ``What I have found to be most remarkable the variety of motivations that drive villains;  they are far more complicated than many people realize.  Many are motivated primarily by averice, and wear a mask of evil to intimidate rather than as a part of their identity.  At the other end of the spectrum, many do not care about riches at all, but simply delight in spreading suffering and misery.  The Incindor, for example, loves lighting villages on fire just to see them burn;  since this makes them difficult to pillage, however, he is among the poorest of villains.  Some, villains, such as Lord Voldemort, have a personal vendetta that they are pursuing, which is often not entirely unjustified.  Then there are those, such as the Soul Eater, who act purely in response to perceived provocation---''

``Hold on there!'' Christina interrupted.  ``The Soul Eater eats souls.  That is his nature;  provocation has nothing to do with it!''

``The Soul Eater has his own soul farm and cares little for riches.  What he hates, however, is having the sanctity of his home violated every hundred years, and every time it happens he terrorizes the land of the living in retaliation.''

``It is completely naive to think that if we stopped raiding his fortress, that he would just suddenly give up tormenting us!''

``How else can one explain the fact that the rate of his attacks has always jumped each time that the Order has raided his home, and then steadily dropped afterward until they are practically non-existent?  Believe me, the Soul Eater has been studied very thoroughly -- at least, as much as possible given the paucity of the data -- and this is the conclusion that has been reached by the experts.  But anyway, I have my studies to attend to.''  He picked up his book.

``Then you are a hypocrit!'' Christina exclaimed.  ``If you really believe that it is raiding his fortress that causes him to terrorize us, then why did you agree to take me there?''

``For three reasons,'' Arthur replied.  ``First and most importantly, the Soul Eater has always fascinated me and I am incredibly fortunate to have been given an opportunity to actually get paid while getting the chance to see his island fortress with my own eyes!  Second, the pay for this mission is very, very good given the hazard.  And thirdly, it will not be a \emph{dragon} that raises his ire, so \emph{we} will not be the ones who feel his wrath.  Why not profit from your foolishness?''  Christina then learned that it was possible for a dragon to smirk, as Arthur returned to his book.

Christina snorted to herself.  Academics -- always inevitable so naive when it comes to the dangers of the world!  As if the Soul Eater would suddenly stop picking on mankind after hundreds of years or terror just because we chose not to harass him back once a century.  What gave these academics the right to think such a silly thing, based on what they themselves admit are a `paucity of data'!  And to believe that some people call the Order is a waste of money.

On the other hand, it was a little disturbing that even the encyclopedia that the Order provided for its heroes (to prepare for the inevitable challenges of wit) failed to mention that dragons were intelligent, thoughtful beings.  She was fortunate that this had never come up on a mission before in her years as a hero, but it was still disturbing.  She would have to bring it up with Bill when she got back.

Ah well, tomorrow was promising to be a long day, so she had best get some rest.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.9:Christina descends to the island
The next morning they woke up, ate breakfast, and then Christina started getting her stuff together for the mission.  Just as she finished, the pilot told her, ``It's best that we leave now, so that we can catch the fortress just at the beginning of its window.''  They mounted Arthur, and took off into the sea.

It didn't take too long for the shore to completely vanish from sight.  As far as she could see, there was water in all directions.  Christina marveled at what it must have took for her predecessor to have found the fortress a hundred years ago, before they had navigational stones that told you where to go and how close you were to reach your destination.

Eventually Christina felt Arthur slow and start to lazily make circles in the sky.  Now that the rushing of wind was not so loud, the pilot was able to speak to Christina.  He turned to her and said, ``This is the spot.  We seem to be here a few minutes early;  it shouldn't be too long until -- oops, there it is!''

Christina, the pilot, and Arthur all looked down at the bright green light that was eminating from the ocean.  Arthur immediately turned and flew away from it just in time as a spray of water shot into the sky and nearly hit them.  Thunder roared as large waves shot out from the center in concentric circles.

Below them, a mountain stood protruding from the water.

As the thunder died down, the pilot turned and shouted to Christina,  ``Are you ready?''

``NO!  Hold on,'' she said, scrummaging through her bags.

She took out her sunglasses, put them on, and gave the pilot a thumbs-up.  ``It's showtime!'' she shouted as she grabbed the ropes of her `fall-breaker' and leapt off the dragon.

Her descent was slow enough that it was going to take her a couple of minutes to make it to her landing spot, so she filled the time by joyfully flying in circles around the island.  She should see if she could borrow do this again for fun sometime, she thought to herself.

Finally, she made the approach for her final landing.  She painted a mental bull-eye on a spot of the new island that was a bit darker than the rest, indicating the presence of a cave.  With precision, she maneuvered her way down and landed right in front of it;  she smoothly absorbed her weight into her legs so that she was able to stay standing.  She smiled with pride at the perfect landing as the fall-breaker fell on top of her and buried her.  She laughed as she emerged from under it.  Well, it looked like she'd already had her glitch of the mission!  That means that it should be smooth sailing from here.  At least, one could hope.

She entered the cave.
%@-node:gcross.20081101130025.9:Christina descends to the island
%@+node:gcross.20081106211237.2:Moat crossing and battle
After a short distance through the cave, she entered the hollow cavern within the mountain.  In the middle was a fortress whose walls were made up of green flames, which flickered with an unearthly slowness.  Surrounding this fortress was a moat filled with lava.

And crocadiles.

To make sure of the latter, Christina took a small piece of meat from her pack, and threw it into the moat.  A mouth snapped from the water and snatched the meat.  It kept its glowing eyes above the water, staring hungrily at her.

Christina chuckled through herself.  If the moat had only been filled with lava, then this would have been a lot harder.  She did a quick calculation in her head, took a deep breath, threw a larger piece of meat into the moat, and then jumped.

A mouth emerged to snatch up the meat, and closed just in time to feel Christina's feet landing on it.  By the time it started to shake her off she had already jumped off to land on another crocadile responding to the meat she had thrown during her first jump.  By this carefully choreographed dance she made her way across the lava on top of the mouths of crocadiles.

There was a reason she was a hero.

When she made it to the other side, she walked to a dark patch of the fortress which appeared to be the door.  Suddenly, a circle of green flames surrounded her from several feet away, and started to close in.

``Before you gain entrance, you must prove yourself to be the Master!'' a voice thundered.  Oddly, the voice was the exact same as that in the Puzzle Master, and every other fortress she had ever been in.  She remebered the first time she had heard it, it had really been quite imposing, but eventually one gets used to the theatrices.

But this was not a time for reflection.  The voice continued,  ``Turn the tumblers to match the five digit entrance code, and you shall be allowed in.  Match the wrong code, and your soul shall be consumed in fire!''

A set of five large tumblers with numbers appeared in front of her.  Christina walked forward and turned them to match the numbers: 1-2-3-4-5.

``Greetings, Master!'' the voice thundered as the flames dropped.  Christina laughed to herself.  One of these days, she supposed, villains would learn that there secret code was not nearly as clever as they thought it was.

The dark spot revealed itself to be a drawbridge which lowered itself across the moat of lava as Christina quickly jumped out of the way.

Just inside the fortress was a large group of shades, glowing figures which looked a lot like a human with a sheet over his head with two holes for eyes, and that just happened to be on fire.  Christina laughed at the rediculity of the image as they drew brightly flaming swords.

``We have been expecting you!'' they said in union.  Well, she had been told that the Soul Eater had not been expecting anybody to attack him, but Christina had learned by now that ``military intelligence'' was an oxymoron.  She casually drew her own glowing swords, drew a cloth from her pouch, and took a couple of moments to polish them as the army continued its collective speech, ``Give up now, foolish mortal, and we shall merely throw your body to the crocadiles to be consumed!''

If there was one thing that bad guys loved to do, it was talk.  She continued to polish her swords while they continued to speak,  ``If you choose to fight us, however, we will not rest with the destruction of your body.  We shall use our swords to peel your flesh off it like the skin of a beat, coat it with olive oil and pieces of peeled garlic, wrap it in oil, bake it in the oven until it is tender, cut it into slices and then feast upon it!''  (Author's Note:  This recipe works as well with beats as it does with souls!)

This speech was somehow both more and less graphic than ones she'd heard in the past.  She finished polishing her swords and put the cloth away.  ``Are you all done yet, or should I get out a book to read while you all keep going?''

They gave an unearthly cry as they rushed forward.

Christina felt that something was missing.  She grumbled to herself as she realized what it was:  her sunglasses had fallen off in the lava!  Ah well, she supposed she would simply have to defeat these bozos with a little less style.

She counted to herself as they rushed towards her.  1... 2... 3... 4...  She leapt to the side as the first row of them ran past into the lava and were snatched up by crocadiles.  She shook her head.  Sometimes it almost didn't seem fair.  But anyway, more time for that thought later.  The remainder of the crowd made a quick turn and suddenly she was surrounded.    The easy part was over.

Now it was time for the fun part!

She gave a Mel Gibson battle cry as she met their swords with her own.  One of the sheet-heads was a little slow.  She cut it in half, and the top half fell to the ground while the legs kept running towards her.  She dropped to the ground as swords flew over her head, picked up the running legs, and tossed them with force at her two sides, knocking one of the sheet-heads to the ground and another into the waiting mouth of a crocadile.

A shade dived at her.  She parried its blow with one hand and made a slash which cut its body vertically into two pieces which fell to the ground.  Since the shade was a little taller than her sword was long, she picked up the half with the arm that wasn't holding the sword and swung it around, knocking many of the shades to the ground.

She continued fighting in this manner until all of her opponents had been cut into pieces on the ground.

``Fool!  You really think that you have won?''  One disembodied head shouted.

``Yes,''  Christina answered, as she kicked the head into the lava and it disappeared with another gulp.  ``So, is anyone willing to surrender?''  she asked the rest of the pieces.

``Umm, I'd raise my hand, but I don't seem to have one any more,'' one answered.

``Too bad,'' Christina replied, as she picked it up and started to toss it into the lava.  The head screamed, and Christina dropped it to the ground.  She laughed.  ``Just messing with you!  Yeah, yeah, by the Code of the Order I hereby accept your surrender and will visit no more harm upon you.''

``Can I get in on that, too?''  another shade-fragment shouted.  ``And me!'' came the voice of another, as all of the pieces with mouths shouted and those with arms waived.

``Ditto for the rest of you too.  Anyway, I need to be going now,'' Christina replied.  She started to turn towards the entrence when a crocadile raised its head out of the lava and started to speak.  ``Thank you, kind sir -- oops, I mean miss!  The Master never bothers to feed us, so we only get to eat once every hundred years when a hero passes through.''  Christina thought for a moment, and then tossed the rest of her pack of raw meat into the lava.  It was immediately snatched up, and then one of the glowing eyes winked at her before sinking back below.

She started to walk into the doorway, and then froze as she heard an unearthly cry from somewhere within;  the Soul Eater was feeding.  She took a deep breath, straightened her resolve, and continued her way in.

The Soul Eater took a bite from his plate.  Needs more garlic, he thought to himself.

Christina burst into the room, brandishing her two glowing swords.  ``Soul Eater, surrender yourself or prepare to meet the wrath of my swords!''  she proclaimed.

The Soul Eater groaned.  ``Why do you heros always have to interrupt my dinner?  You'd think that a demon could get a little peace in his own home...''

``YARGH!!!''  Christina screamed as she lunged towards him.

``Very well then, I surrender,'' the Soul Eater said, calmly.

``YA-- What?'' Christina said as she stopped herself short, causing her to trip over herself and stumble for a bit.  She collected herself and attempted to regain her composure while blushing.  ``Pardon me?'' she asked.

``I believe that by the Code of the Order, you are not allowed to hurt me after I surrender, correct?'' the Soul Eater replied.

``Well, technically,'' Christina grumbled.  ``But... the terms are that you must agree to surrender all of your treasure, or else I shall force you to pay!''

``Of course, of course.  Butler!''  he shouted.  A sheet-head entered the room.  ``Take this woman to the treasury and help her pack as much of it as she can take.''

``But,'' Christina fumed, ``you loathsome creature, I... you can't just surrender, we're supposed to fight!  Don't you care about your gold?''

The Soul Eater took another bite.  ``Oh, and Butler?  A little more garlic next time, if you please.  Ah, hero, no, why should I care?  What need have I for gold?  True, I used to enjoy watching the suffering that was caused by my stealing it, but I am growing old and don't have the energy for such adventures any more.  In fact, I was thinking of moving to a smaller place, so I appreciate you helping me clean this one out of its junk.''

Butler started to walk down the corridor, and gestured for Christina to follow.  ``This way, miss.''

Christina fumed, but started to turn to follow him.  She stopped an turned back, shaking her sword.  ``This won't be the last you'll see of me!'' she proclaimed, as she turned away and followed Butler.

``Of course,'' the Soul Eater said to himself, unheard, as he resumed his dinner.

%@+node:gcross.20081108185724.2:Raiding the treasury
Christina stared in awe.  She had never seen so much treasure in one place before.  Of course, it didn't help that she had never made it all the way to a villain's vault before, but she was sure that if she had it couldn't possibly have been as much as this.  She had to crane her head just to see the top of it.

A large number of shades were standing around.  ``We have been instructed to help you,'' one told her.  ``As you know, there is only a couple of hours left until this place leaves your world, and the master really wants all of this to have been loaded by then, so perhaps we should begin now?  Or do you need more time to gawk?''

Christina flushed.  ``No, no, here is my bag of holding.  Load it all in there,'' she said, handing the sheet-head a bag from her pouch.  She wondered how they could possibly load it all in time!

Answering her unspoken question, the shades flew into action, becoming blurs against the mountain of treasure.  A river of gold quickly flew down from the mountain and entered her bag.

After a fraction of a second, the bag had been filled and was dropped to the ground.  One of the shades looked at her.  ``You came all this way and went to all this trouble to take our master's treasure, and this was the biggest bag you could find?''

Christina stared for a moment.  This wasn't possible.  It was an infinite bag of holding, it wasn't possible to fill up.

She walked over and inspected it.  It did indeed appear to be full.  She lifted it;  it was heavy.  It wasn't supposed to be heavy.

Was it possible she brought the wrong bag?  No, of course not.  After all, she had already made that mistake once before, and to protect against doing it again she set up a system:  the infinite bag of holding was always kept in her top shelf, and all other bags were kept in other shelves.  Never one had she violated this, so it couldn't possibly be...

Then, suddenly, an image entered her mind of the night that Homer had helped her clean her place up... of Homer placing her decorated, decidedly non-infinite bag into her top shelf, and her not doing anything about it.

She groaned, and shook her head.

One of the shades grinned an unholy grin.  ``Wait... or perhaps you were supposed to have brought a larger bag?  Did you really just accidently bring the wrong bag all of this way?''  He started to chunkle.  ``I can't believe this.  I have seen heros do all many of stupid things before, but to make it all this way and have forgotten the means of taking your loot home...''  He broke into a laugh.

All of the rest of the shades followed.  Many of them collapsed against the walls, or on the ground, as they were overcome with laughter.

Christina's face grew redder and redder.  ``Stop laughing!'' she cried.  The shades ignored her.  ``STOP LAUGHING!'' she shouted louder.

``Not anyone!  Only a collosal \emph{fool}!''  one laughed.  He stopped for a moment, and looked at her closely.  ``Oh, wait a minute.  You are a human... female, aren't you?  Ah, now it makes sense;  we have heard the legends of the woman hero who never failed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, and I couldn't believe it.  But now that I've seen you in person... you are even \emph{stupider} than the stories had told!''  He started laughing again, louder than before.

``AAAAAA!'' Christina shouted, as she snapped.  She drew her two swords and started slashing the sheet-heads into pieces.

It took them a moment to realize what was happening, but by then it was too late.  ``Wait,'' one cried, ``we surrender!  We AUGH'' it shouted as it fell apart.

In a couple of minutes, it was all over;  body parts were strewn all over the floor.

Christina felt a little better, but... technically she had just performed a major violation of the Code.  You weren't supposed to attack people who surrendered without provocation, and she doubted that mocking would be considered sufficient cause.

Well, it's not like anybody would ever find out...

But the question remained:  what to do now?  She had a couple of hours to kill, and since everyone had surrendered and she had all of the treasure she could carry, there was nothing more that she could do.

Or was there...  She remembered the scream she heard as she entered the castle, and thought of the stories of the soul farm that was kept in this fortress.  But, she was only equipped to bring home treasure--or in theory she had been, at least--now equipped to rescue anyone... On the other hand, being a hero was all about being the queen of improvisation, was it not?  And it wasn't just about saving lives;  it was about saving souls!

She made her decision, and started to storm back upstairs as pieces of sheet-heads continued to groan behind her.

``Soul Eater, I told you we would meet again!''  Christina shouted, swords drawn, as she stormed into the room and the Soul Eater, startled, dropped his fork.  He glared at her.  ``What do you want now?''

``Instruct your minions to free the souls in your farm!''

His eyes widened.  ``No, hero, you go too far!''

``Do you accept my terms, or shall we fight?'' she said, brandishing her weapons.

``Fool!''  he shouted  ``You don't know what this would mean to your world.  I was about to retire from raiding you entirely -- well, except perhaps for the occasional snack, of course -- but if you steal my food supply then I shall be forced to rob you of souls again!''

``Yeah, right, you expect me to believe that you were really about to stop raiding us?  That you would really be satisfied with your soul farm alone?'' she asked sarcastically.

``Haven't you noticed that my raids have been getting less and less frequent?''

``And I am suppose to believe that this is more than just a coincidence?''

``You don't understand,'' he sighed.   ``I... my stomach isn't like it used to be when I was younger.  I would prefer to eat the souls of your world but they are too... spicey.''

``Spicey?''  Christina asked.

``Yes... they have too much personality and character.  Part of the reason why I started a soul farm was to breed bland human beings who's souls sit much better with me.  I try spicing them up with garlic, but believe me it simply isn't the same...''

``Well, I don't care, you shall free them, or else!''

``Are you not listening to me?  I just told you that I am about to retire raiding your world \emph{unless} my soul farm is taken away from me and I have to start raiding again just to eat!  And I have put so, so many years into breeding them to be just right...  and now like the last hero you are going to force me to start all over again?  Didn't you learn from the last time your stupid order did this to me?''

Christina paused.  Really?  The last hero had freed souls from him?  Why hadn't she heard of this?  Was he speaking the truth?  Now that she thought about, it was true that he had been hearing of fewer raids of late... actually, it seems like he hasn't even raided every year of late.  And if she freed his souls, then he would indeed be motivated to raid more often.  But could she really be motivated to leave them behind?  That is a horrible possibility, but perhaps it would be in the interest of the greater good...

Then a picture entered her mind of a crowd cheering her triumphant return home, celebrating her rescue of innocent souls from the malevolent hands of the Soul Eater.  Could she really let them down?  Could she bring herself to return home empy-handed, yet again?

She was resolved:  the cheering crowds would be hers this time!

``Soul Eater, your word cannot distract me from the fact that you are holding innocent souls captive so that you can entreat upon them the greatest form of suffering known to humankind!''

``Can you really blame me?  A demon's got to eat...'' the Soul Eater grumbled.

``If you will not surrender them then prepare to feel my wrath!  YARRGH!'' she shouted, charging at him.

Suddenly, he transformed into a ball of fire.  ``Foolish hero!''  He shot bolts of flame towards her.

She dodged the first and deflected the second with her sword.

``Is that the best you can AIIEE'' she shouted as a shock wave threw her against the wall.  She looked around the room.  Projectiles... she needed projectiles...  She grabbed chairs and started tossing them at the ball of fire;  the were easily brushed aside, but as he was distracted she was able to get closer to him.  Now she was in sword-swinging range, but swords were not going to be the defeat of this demon, so she carefully swung her sword very slowly, holding onto it loosely, and acted surprised when the  Soul Eater blasted it out of her hand.  ``No!'' she shreaked.

``Expect no mercy from me, hero, for you shall receive--NO!'' it groaned as Christina Sceptre of Power was quickly yanked from her bag and with a click it shot to its full length into the Soul Eater.

Once again, Christina thought to herself, saved by a villain's need to monologue at the moment of perceived victory.

``Soul Eater, by the power of the Sceptre you will instruct your minions to assist me in freeing your captive souls.''

The ball of fire screeched, flickering, and finally settled down back into humanoid sheet-head form.  ``Very well, hero.  Butler!''  A shade entered the room.  ``Take us to the soul farm.''

``Wait, didn't I just kill...  Erm, I mean, how you can tell that this one is Butler?  Don't they all look alike?'' she asked the Soul Eater as they started their way down the corridor.

``Yes they do, hero, so I solved that problem by naming \emph{all} of my minions Butler in order to save myself trouble,'' the Soul Eater grumbled.

Christina was disgusted.  Before her was a wall covered with hundreds of cages, with a naked human being in each one.  Excrement was piled in a pool underneath all of the cages.  The indecency of the whole thing horrified her!

What also amazed her, though, was how still they all were;  there was a blanket covering each head.

``How do you keep them all so sedate?''  she asked the Soul Eater.

``They are so stupid that when we cover their heads, they think it is night,'' he replied.

``Instruct your minions to free them!''  she commanded.

The Soul Eater grappled with himself for a moment, but as the stone of power inside of him flared he spat out the words, ``Release the humans!''

The sheet-heads in the room opened the cages.

``Wake up, you are free!'' she proclaimed to the humans inside.

They continued sleeping.

``Tell the minions to remove the blankets over their eyes,''  she commanded.

``Do as the hero requests,'' the soul eater spat, placing particular emphasis of disgust on the word `hero'.

``Are you sure you want to do this?  They are so stupid that the higher ones might just fall to their deaths.''

``Don't be ridiculous!  These are human beings, not animals.  Just do it.''

The minions went from cage to cage, pulling the blankets from the heads of the humans sleeping within.

``Wake up, sleepy-heads!  You are free!'' she shouted.  ``Oh, and get them some ladders while you are at it,'' she said to the Soul Eater.

As the blankets were removed, the humans started to roll around and wake up.  Some of them weren't looking where they were going and fell out of the cages.  The ones near the bottom just got bruised, but there were unpleasant cracks from the people falling from the higher ones.

Christina was dumbstruck.

``I told you so,'' said the Soul Eater, smugly.

``How... how do you normally get them down?'' Christina asked.

``With tongs,'' the Soul Eater replied.

``Then... order your minions to do whatever they need to do to get the humans down here unhurt,'' Christina ordered.

``You heard her, Butler.  Get the humans down here intact,'' the Soul Eater relayed to the sheet-heads.

They stopped unblinding the human and started making systematic use of tongs to lower the humans to the ground.  It is fortunate that they are so fast, she thought to herself, watching their blurred motions, given how many there are.

``How many people were disabled by the fall?''  Christina asked.

``In a way, you are fortunate.  Those were only necks that you heard breaking.  No humans were disabled;  some were merely killed is all.  So they will not be slowing you down, if that is what you were worried about,''  the Soul Eater replied, smirking.

Christina gasped;  it wasn't supposed to be happening this way.  What had happened to these people?

As if he hard hear her question, the Soul Eater continued, ``As I said;  I bred these humans to be as bland as possible so that their souls would go well with my stomach.  You should pay more attention to things, hero.''

``Well, bland or not they are still human, so wake them all up!''  Christina demanded.

``As you wish.''

The minions removed blankets from the heads of the remaining humans and soon all of them awoke.

``You are free!  Come with me, and I will take you all away from this place!''  Christina attempted to proclaim once more.

They ignored her, and ran around the room haphazardly, making random grunting noises.

``What part of they have been raised to be stupid didn't you understand, hero?  You pathetic humans actually need to be taught to talk, and it was not desirable for me to do so,'' the Soul Eater sneered.

Christina was stumped.  What was she supposed to do now?  These human beings were really no more than animals.

But they are more than animals, she thought to herself.  If they didn't have souls, after all, then they would have no value to the Soul Eater at all.

``How do you get them to move from place to place?'' Christina asked.

``We herd them, just like what you human beings call cattle,'' the Soul Eater replied.

``Then... herd them towards the exit.''

The Soul Eater nodded towards his minions, who started to herd the mass of wild humanity down the hallway to the entrance of the castle.

``Why can't you make them cross?''  Christina fumed.

``My minions are trying,'' the Soul Eater replied, ``but understandably, the humans are afraid of the lava, and they don't even know about the crocadiles.''

Christina watched as the mass of humans huddled around the start of the drawbridge, too afraid to cross but also afraid of the whips that were keeping them from retreating.

``Must we use whips?'' Christina asked.

``I would be happy to let them run amok again, if that is what you really want,'' the Soul Eater replied.

Christina sighed, then gasped.  As the throng of humans was pushed closer to the edge, some of them were getting perilously close to the edge.

Two eyes popped up from the lava.

Christina spoke quickly, ``Order the crocadiles not to eat the humans!''

The Soul Eater laughed, ``The crocadiles do not listen to me, nor do they need to be useful to me;  the only follow their own hunger.''

``Then, tell your minions to back off!''

``Too late,'' the Soul Eater replied smugly, as one of the humans was pushed off the edge by the people behind him.  Christina closed her eyes, waiting to hear the inevitable snap, or perhaps just a scream as flesh hit hot lava.

To her surprise, several moments later she realized that she had heard neither.  She opened her eyes again.  The human being was now actually being carried across the lava by a crocadile!

More people were being pushed into the lava, and more crocadiles arrived just in time to bear them across.

One poked its head out of the lava, winked at Christina, and said, ``We figured we owe you one, hero,'' and then took its turn in bearing a human across.

The Soul Eater shrieked.  ``Traitors!  Useless reptiles!  Don't you know who your Master is?'' he yelled.  Then he paused, thought for a moment, and then said more quietly,  ``Oh, that reminds me, I really should feed you one of these days, shouldn't I...''

During all of this, the humans, seeing that their members were crossing the lava unhurt, decided that the drawbridge wasn't so scary after all, so the mass decided to cross.  Some continued to fall off the sides, and were carried over by crocadiles as well.

Christina breathed a sigh of relief, and made her way following the humans down the cave, with the Soul Eater continuing in tow, tethered by the Sceptre of Power.

Well, the easy part is now over, Christina thought to herself, as she stared at the vast waters between her and the mainland.

``So, hero, what are you going to do now.''

She looked up, and saw a dragon circling overhead.  Something was headed... she jumped out of the way as an arrow struck the shore next to her.  There was a piece of paper rolled around the arrow.  She removed it and started to read.

\texttt{Hero, you are crazy if you think that we can bring all of these people home!  Even if Arthur were willing to fly that close, there is no way that he could possibly lift so many human beings at once.  So inflate the balloon and get up here already so that we can go home!}

Christina sighed.  Civilians could be so cowardly at times.  But he was right;  there was no way that Arthur could lift all of these people.  How on Earth was she going to get them home.

She thought about it for a few moments.  She needed some kind of craft that could carry them.  She didn't have anything that floated, however...

But she did have something that flew!  She could use her balloon to lift them into the sky, and then have Arthur pull them along!  But how was she going to get all of them attached to the balloon.  She could tie them, but she didn't have enough rope.

The ground started to shake, and there were many screams of panic from the former prisoners.  Then it settled again, but some of the water around it was starting to steam.

``Soul Eater, how much time do I have before this island leaves our world?''  Christina asked.

``About twenty minutes, hero,'' the Soul Eater replied.

Oh Greg, what do I do now?  she thought to herself.  What would Patrick have done in this situation.  Then it hit her:  he would fight for the good, not for the perfect.  If not everone could come with her, then not everyone was going to.

This changed the scale of the problem, but not its nature.  The humans continued to scramble around haphazardly.  It would be good if she could get them to calm down.  How was it that the Soul Eater had done it again?  That's right, blankets over their eyes.  If only she had...

Then it hit her.  She looked at her fallen fall-breaker.  It looked like it could hold about twenty people.  She turned to the Soul Eater and ordered, ``Instruct your minions to drive twenty of them under the cloth on the ground.''

``Under?''

``Yes, have some of them pick it up, and then drop it on their heads.''

They did so;  the humans underneath fell to the ground and started sleeping.

``Now tell them to wrap the humans up inside the cloth in a bundle.''

As they did this, the Soul Eater said to her, ``If you are only planning to take twenty people from me, then perhaps I shall only raid your world lightly in return.''

``Oh, I may only be able to take twenty people home from me, but I plan on saving \emph{all} of them.  Tell your minions to drive them into the sea.''

The Soul Eater snorted in fury.  ``What?  You will completely waste them?''

``I might not be able to save their bodies, but I can save their souls.''

``No, I refuse!  I...''  He fought the stone for a moment.

``Soul Eater, drive the humans into the sea!''  Christina ordered.

The Soul Eater slumped.  ``Minions, do as she commands,'' he commanded softly.

Christina watched as the frightened humans were forced to the shore, and then driven onward and onward, until they were all submerged.

For the first time in the last hour, it was perfectly quiet.  Christina couldn't help shedding a tear as she got the float ball out of her pocket, tied together some ropes to form a harness for herself, and then tied the end of the rope to the bundle of bodies in her fall-breaker.

Steam was now rising water just outside the shore.  She turned toward the Soul Eater and gave him one last order, ``You will return into your fortress and allow us to return unharmed.''

``As you command, hero.  But this time, let me be the one to say:  this will not be the last time that you see me,'' he growled, as Christina released him from the stone and he and his minions made their way back through the cave.

Christina squeezed the ball three times, and it inflated bringing her and her burden into the air.

Christina was far above the island when it finally disappeared.  It's disappearance was not quite as dramatic as its arrival -- which was good thing, considering that she was not nearly as manueverable as Arthur had been! -- but it was still impressive.  It grew simultaneously brighter as the rock started to glow and darker as it sunk below the waters until the last of it had disappeared below the waters with a sudden flash.

She was worried for a moment that it might keep rising forever, but fortunately it eventually stopped rising just as Arthur arrived next to it.  The pilot shrugged at her.  They were too far apart to be able to hear each other, so Christina finished tying some of her rope into a hoop and tossed it just behind Arthur's neck;  he reflexively tried to dodge it, but instead managed to move his head right to where it was falling.  Christina smiled;  she was good.

Arthur turned towards her, and her body vibrated as she heard the words thunder out of his mouth, ``My fees have just doubled.''

He turned, and started flying back to the mainland, with Christina's balloon and cargo in tow.

After a couple of hours of flying, they finally arrived at the town of Wayton, a port city on the coast.  Christina looked down, and there was a crowd so large that it could clearly be seen from their height in the air.  Her heart was warmed;  there were there for her!

She looked up again and saw the dragoneer trying to tell her something.  He was still a little too far away to be heard, so after a few minutes Arthur turned his head to her and said sardonically,  ``Shall I assume, hero, that you have an equally brilliant plan for getting yourself down?''

Christina grinned.  Of course she did!  She pulled out her sword and cut herself free of Arthur.  Then she pulled herself up a little bit on the rope, and very carefully poked a small hole into the float ball.  There was a barely audible whistle as air flew out of the hole, and the ball began to lower itself to the ground.

As it did so, Christina realized that she was getting propelled away from the crowd, so she carefully punched another hole on the other side.

This made her fall a little faster.  After a few minutes, she saw more clearly that there was a stage set up for her, and she was slowly drifting away from it.  She carefully punched yet another hole in the ball, though a smaller one.  The ball started falling noticebly faster, though not alarmingly so.  She realized that she should be more sparing in the holes she used to manuever.

She continued to make her way slowly down, very occasionally punching another small hole in the float ball, until she was nearly at the ground.  By this time, her freed prisoners were nearly to the ground, just to the side of the platform; her aiming had been perfect.  Just as they touched the ground (with enough force to bruise, but hopefully not enough to break any bones) she cut a larger hole in the float ball to propell herself towards the stage.  When she was a few feet above, she dramatically leapt off and landed on her feet.  She bowed as the crowd started to cheer loudly, and the float ball collapsed on top of her.

Well, you can't have everything.

Since the float ball was wrecked by this point anyway, she cut herself free of it, took another bow, and walked over to the podium.  It had only taken her a few minutes to figure out her plan for getting down, so she had the rest of the trip to think about exactly what she was going to say.

She began, ``Thank you all for coming here today!  I am sorry to say that the Soul Eater is not quite as happy today as we are.''  Laughter.  ``For the first time, the Soul Eater has been forced to relinquish his ill-gotten treasure to us!''  Cheers.  Christina waited for the crowd to settle.  ``And the treasure I have recovered is far, far more valuable than silver or gold.  Many of you may have heard the stories of the Soul Farm that he kept to satisfy his unholy hunger.  Well, I can tell you that such a thing used to exist.. until today!  All of the souls in  his captivity have now been freed!''  Cheers.  She continued, ``The Soul Eater is going to be very hungry tonight, but please try not to weep too many tears from him.''  Laughter.  ``And so I present to you now:  the rescued souls!''  She ran off the platform and cut open the fall-breaker to reveal the pile of naked bodies within.

The crowds first reaction was to be shocked to see so much humanity presented so indecently, and wondering if they were even alive.  But as the former prisoners started to get up, the crowd started to cheer -- although there was still a touch of confusion in it revealed by the fact that they were not quite cheering as loudly as before.

The combination of seeing such a large group of people and hearing the roar of their cheers frightened the prisoners and caused them to huddle together.

But if the cheer was not as loud as before, or the prisoners no quite acting like they were happy to be free, Christina didn't notice.  This was her moment of triumph, and it was going to be viewed through rose-colored glasses no matter what actually happened.

She ran back up to the podium triumphantly, and continued to speak.  ``Now, these people were in very harsh conditions and will need your help.  I will be flying out tomorrow so I shall leave them in your care.  I beseige you to treat them as the long lost family members that they are and to ttreat them with kindness until they have recovered from the madness of their condition.  I promise you that the Order will recomponse you for your service in this.''  In her triumphant moved, she glossed over the fact that she would have to talk them into doing this;  but she was bouyed with confidence at this point and was convinced she could accomplish anything.

The crowd was silent during this.  `
