The guard leaned casually next to the door, chewing nicotine free tobacco.  “You know Marv,” he grumbled.  “It seems like we spend all of our lives alternating between standing here conscious but bored, or unconscious after some hero arrives and knocks us out.  Ever feel like we were meant for something more than this?”

The other guard started to reply, but then he immediately alternated to the latter of the two states as Christina gave him a quick kick to the head.

“Dammit,” shrieked Marv as he attempted to quickly draw his sword.  “Now ag--”  He didn’t get to finish his sentence, but dropped to the floor instead.

Christina fished around Marv’s pocket for the key to the door, and let herself in.  “Thank God they always give keys to the guards,” she thought to herself as she unlocked the door.

She entered and found herself inside a chamber.  The door slammed close behind her as a voice boomed, “You must now prove that you are the Master by solving a crossword puzzle of such difficulty that only the genius of the Master himself could pass.  Fail, and your body shall be reduced to ashes.”  A set of squares faded on the wall to her left, and writing appeared on the wall to her right.  She walked up to the writing and read through it.  It would require someone with encyclopedic knowledge to figure it out.

Happily, she had just re-memorized the encyclopedia that morning.

“You have thirty minutes to complete the puzzle,” the voice boomed.  Christina shook her head;  the Puzzle Master couldn’t possibly be as smart as he thought he was if it really took him a whole thirty minutes to solve his own puzzle.  She walked to the other side of the chamber, saying a silent prayer for the piles of ashes that lay next to it, picked up the chisel and hammer, and systematically completed the puzzle in less than ten minutes.

“Welcome, Master!”  the voice boomed as both doors opened.  She smiled with satisfaction as she walked through and entered the treasury.

A large vault stood before her;  on the inside of this vault lay all the treasure which the Puzzle Master had accumulated from several years of pillaging.  All she had to do now was open the door, load it into her weightless infinite bag of holding, and return home.

She smiled.  This was almost too easy.  She reached into her left pocket for her universal lock-pick.

It wasn’t there.

“Oops, I can never remember which pocket I put that thing in,” she thought to herself as she reached into her right pocket.

It wasn’t there, either.

She cursed, quickly fumbling through the rest of her pockets.  She then had a vision of the lock-pick sitting on her desk as she left her home a week ago...

Oh god, not again.

She screamed and kicked at the door a few times just to see it would bulge.  Her foot hurt now, and her morale hadn’t improved.  In a deep funk, she started to make her way out of the fortress.

Marv had regained consciousness by now, and was rubbing his temple as she left the Puzzle Chamber.  “Wait, did you really just come all this way, simply to forget you lock pick and get stuck?”  He looked at her, and started to laugh, “Oh, now I recognize you.  You’re Christina, aren’t you?  Man, I’ve heard stories, but to actually see how stu--” His laughter came to an abrupt end as his body slammed into the wall.

She glared at the other guard.  “Do you have anything to say?”

His face paled.  Unlike Marv, he had also heard the stories of her legendary temper.  Mollified, he asked  “Umm, Miss, if you’re leaving anyway, could we please have our key back?  The Master gets really mad at us when we lose it...”

She rolled her eyes, and threw the key at him.  It knocked him in the forehead and he was down again.

She sulked as she made her way out of the fortress.  Unfortunately, nobody else was stupid enough to mock or harass her on the way out, so she didn’t get any other opportunities to take out her frustration on someone.

Her horse was waiting for her outside.  She got on it and started making her way back to the village.  She grimaced in anticipation of what was to come.

At least the crowd awaiting her return this time was a little smaller than usual, but it was still there.  As she entered the town, they started cheering, ``Hooray!  She has returned victorious from the Puzzle Master!''    They were half right, but only half.  They quieted as she made her way to the center of the town, where a platform had been set up for her to make a speech.  They waited for her to mount it, but instead she just kept riding past.

Some caught on right away, but others were confused.  ``Why is she not making a speech proclaiming her victory?'' they asked themselves, as she made her way to the town inn.  ``Could it be...''

She parked her horse in the stables and went up to her room.  She quickly packed up the remainder of her things for travelling, gave the last of her money to the innkeeper to pay for her stay, and made her way to the exit.  On her way out, a child eagerly shouted, ``How much treasure did you get from him?'' before his mom hushed him up and gave Christina a look of sympathy.  Christina shook her head, and started making her way out of town.

Thankfully, most of the crowd had dispersed by this time, though the podium remained as a monument to her failure.  One man was waiting by the gate for her, and jeered as she rode by. ``You damn heroes have been taking our money for years to support your adventures, and now that you finally get around to taking care of us you accomplish absolutely nothing!''  She just hung her head as she made her way out.

Christina started on the long ride home.  Unfortunately, she didn't have any money to pay for inns or food;  she had been given only enough to get her to the Puzzle Master, under the assumption that she would be able to use the treasure she got from the castle to fund her way back.  It thus took her twice as long to return home as it had for her to make it out here, since she had to take time to hunt and gather to feed herself, and to set up camp and night.  She was good at these things, but this time she took no pleasure in them.

After two weeks of (unfortunately) uneventful travelling, she finally made it back to her home town.  There was enough daylight left that she had enough time to drop off her stuff at her room in the barracks, return her horse to the stables, and make her way to the town pub.  She needed to get drunk as quickly as possible, and decided that was worth taking the risk that people would actually see her.

Happily, the place was not packed.  She sat down at the bar.  The bartender walked over to her with a look of concern, but Christina just told her, ``I want a pan-galactic gargle blaster.  No; on second thought, make that a double.''

As she nursed her drink, she started to look over the other faces at the pub.  She was hoping to see her close friend Homer, but he was not here.  She took a big swallow, and then looked up.  A man was staring a her;  a very handsome one.  She locked eyes with him, and her heart leapt.  Could it be... was this the one?

He started to make his way towards her, his eyes locked into hers, and it was clear that they were both thinking the same thing.

She nerviously brushed through her hair to fix herself up.  People were always trying to convince her that there was no such thing as ``love at first sight,'' but here she was experiencing it at last!

She continued to stare into his eyes as he approached and started to greet him as he walked straight past her and started talking to the girl right behind her.

``Your eyes... I have never seen anything like them.''  He told her, as they gazed at each other, completely oblivious to anything else.  He took her hand and kissed it.  ``It is warm in here.  Would you care to take a walk outside with me to cool off?''  ``Gladly,'' she replied, smiling.  He took her arm, and they left the pub.

Christina slumped.  Not again, she thought to herself.  I mean, honestly, what were the odds that this would happen to her five times in a row?  Was she really naive to think that the guy was actually staring into her eyes, this time?

She felt an arm wrap around her.  ``Hey buddy,'' a man said to her.  ``I saw what happened.  You really have the worst luck with these things.''

She gave Homer a smile -- small, but warm -- as she pressed herself against him for a moment.  The two of them had started their hero training together, and had developed a close friendship over the years.  ``This really isn't my day;  or my month, for that matter,'' she told him.

Homer looked at her with concern.  ``What happened this time?''

``So, I made it all the way into his fortress --- and really, you should have seen me!  He had no less than seven gangs of ninjas waiting for me, each versed in a different martial arts style in the hope that one of them would be able to take me down.  Of course, in his arrogance he gave them nearly all of the keys to his castle so as I took each one down it was easy as pie to make my way around.  And his puzzle chambers... I mean, honestly, who \emph{couldn't} solve the differential equation $dz=\frac{1}{3}x^2\,dx+\frac{1}{3}y^2\,dy$ in their head?  It's basic integration!  And, god, he keeps re-using so many of his crossword clues that I stopped having to even think about half of them...''

``And then,''  Homer asked?

``And then I realized that I had forgotten the stupid lock-pick that I needed to get into his vault.  Honestly, I feel so stupid...''

``You're not stupid, Christina, just a little absent minded is all.''  He took a deep breath.  ``You know, I really didn't want to bring this up, but maybe it is time that you thought about whether this is really the right line of work for you...''

She glared at him.  ``You're right, that is a very bad point for you to bring up.''

Homer continued.  ``Seriously though, Christina.  You are good at so many things.  You fight like a human tornado and you think like a master scholar.  But to be a hero requires more than these things;  you need to have the ability to get \emph{all} of the details right, not merely most of them, and if you can't do that then you are just being a danger to yourself.  There is a reason, after all, that are not allowed to have partners anymore.''

She flushed and pulled away from him.  ``I choose not to have partners because they keep slowing me down and getting in my way!  How can I help if they keep putting themselves in front of my leg when I am in the middle of kicking people?'

``They were trying to help you...''

``Well maybe I don't need any help!'' she shouted at him.  Then she relaxed and slouched.  ``Sorry, I know that you are just trying to help.''

``No, the fault is mine;  I shouldn't have brought it up.  Here, I'll buy you a drink to make it up to you,'' Homer graciously conceded.

She smiled at him.  ``Oh, stop it, you know that I was being unreasonable and are just too nice to say it.  You really treat me too well, you know that?''

He returned the smile.  ``Hey, what other hero can I go picking up guys with?  Oops, another sore point,'' he said as she slouched again.

``Why do the guys always go for the girl next to me, Homer?  Am I really so ugly?''

Homer sighed.  ``Of course not, Christina.  Perhaps it's just that you can come across as being a little, well, intimidating at times?''

``I AM NOT INTIMIDATING!''  she shouted as she slammed her hand onto the bar.  Unfortunately, the hand did not stop at the bar, but made its way all the way through as the bar was split into two pieces.

Homer tried to avoid laughing as Christina blushed.  ``You know, maybe there is such a thing as doing too many wood breaking drills...  I really need to get myself out of the habit of doing this.''
