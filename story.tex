%@+node:gcross.20081101122204.3:Christina forgets her lockpick
The guard leaned casually next to the door, chewing nicotine free tobacco.  “You know Marv,” he grumbled.  “It seems like we spend all of our lives alternating between standing here conscious but bored, or unconscious after some hero arrives and knocks us out.  Ever feel like we were meant for something more than this?”

The other guard started to reply, but then he immediately alternated to the latter of the two states as Christina gave him a quick kick to the head.

``Dammit,'' shrieked Marv as he attempted to quickly draw his sword.  ``Not ag--''  He didn’t get to finish his sentence, but dropped to the floor instead.

Christina fished around Marv’s pocket for the key to the door, and let herself in.  She may have had a universal lock-pick on her, but there was always a certain satisfaction to using a key you had won for yourself.

She entered and found herself inside a chamber.  The door slammed close behind her as a voice boomed, ``You must now prove that you are the Master by solving a crossword puzzle of such difficulty that only the genius of the Master himself could pass.  Fail, and your body shall be reduced to ashes.''  A set of squares faded on the wall to her left, and writing appeared on the wall to her right.  She walked up to the writing and read through it.  It would require someone with encyclopedic knowledge to figure it out.

Happily, she had just re-memorized the encyclopedia that morning.

``You have thirty minutes to complete the puzzle,'' the voice boomed.  Christina shook her head;  the Puzzle Master couldn’t possibly be as smart as he thought he was if it really took him a whole thirty minutes to solve his own puzzle.  She walked to the other side of the chamber, saying a silent prayer for the piles of ashes that lay next to it, picked up the chisel and hammer, and systematically completed the puzzle in less than ten minutes.

``Welcome, Master!''  the voice boomed as both doors opened.  She smiled with satisfaction as she walked through and entered the treasury.

A large vault stood before her;  on the inside of this vault lay all the treasure which the Puzzle Master had accumulated from several years of pillaging.  All she had to do now was open the door, load it into her weightless infinite bag of holding, and return home.

She smiled.  This was almost too easy.  She reached into her left pocket for her universal lock-pick.

It wasn’t there.

``Oops, I can never remember which pocket I put that thing in,'' she thought to herself as she reached into her right pocket.

It wasn’t there, either.

She cursed, quickly fumbling through the rest of her pockets.  She then had a vision of the lock-pick sitting on her desk as she left her home a week ago...

Oh god, not again.

She screamed and kicked at the door a few times just to see it would bulge.  Her foot hurt now, and her morale hadn’t improved.  In a deep funk, she started to make her way out of the fortress.

Marv had regained consciousness by now, and was rubbing his temple as she left the Puzzle Chamber.  ``Wait, did you really just come all this way, simply to forget you lock pick and get stuck?''  He looked at her, and started to laugh, ``Oh, now I recognize you.  You’re Christina, aren’t you?  Man, I’ve heard stories, but to actually see how stu--'' His laughter came to an abrupt end as his body slammed into the wall.

She glared at the other guard.  “Do you have anything to say?”

His face paled.  Unlike Marv, he had also heard the stories of her legendary temper.  Mollified, he asked  ``Umm, Miss, if you’re leaving anyway, could we please have our key back?  The Master gets really mad at us when we lose it...''

She rolled her eyes, and threw the key at him.  It knocked him in the forehead and he was down again.

She sulked as she made her way out of the fortress.  Unfortunately, nobody else was stupid enough to mock or harass her on the way out, so she didn’t get any other opportunities to take out her frustration on someone.

Her horse was waiting for her outside.  She got on it and started making her way back to the village.  She grimaced in anticipation of what was to come.

%@+node:gcross.20081101122204.6:A unwelcome waiting committee
At least the crowd awaiting her return this time was a little smaller than usual, but it was still there.  As she entered the town, they started cheering, ``Hooray!  She has returned victorious from the Puzzle Master!''    They were half right, but only half.  They quieted as she made her way to the center of the town, where a platform had been set up for her to make a speech.  They waited for her to mount it, but instead she just kept riding past.

Some caught on right away, but others were confused.  ``Why is she not making a speech proclaiming her victory?'' they asked themselves, as she made her way to the town inn.  ``Could it be...''

She parked her horse in the stables and went up to her room.  She quickly packed up the remainder of her things for travelling, gave the last of her money to the innkeeper to pay for her stay, and made her way to the exit.  On her way out, a child eagerly shouted, ``How much treasure did you get from him?'' before his mom hushed him up and gave Christina a look of sympathy.  Christina shook her head, and started making her way out of town.

Thankfully, most of the crowd had dispersed by this time, though the podium remained as a monument to her failure.  One man was waiting by the gate for her, and jeered as she rode by. ``You damn heroes have been taking our money for years to support your adventures, and now that you finally get around to taking care of us you accomplish absolutely nothing!''  She just hung her head as she made her way out.

\timeskip

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.2:At the bar
Christina started on the long ride home.  Unfortunately, she didn't have any money to pay for inns or food;  she had been given only enough to get her to the Puzzle Master, under the assumption that she would be able to use the treasure she got from the castle to fund her way back.  It thus took her twice as long to return home as it had for her to make it out here, since she had to take time to hunt and gather to feed herself, and to set up camp and night.  She was good at these things, but this time she took no pleasure in them.

After two weeks of (unfortunately) uneventful travelling, she finally made it back to her home town.  There was enough daylight left that she had enough time to drop off her stuff at her room in the barracks, return her horse to the stables, and make her way to the town pub.  She needed to get drunk as quickly as possible, and decided that was worth taking the risk that people would actually see her.

Happily, the place was not packed.  She sat down at the bar.  The bartender walked over to her with a look of concern, but Christina just told her, ``I want a pan-galactic gargle blaster.  No; on second thought, make that a double.''

As Christina nursed her drink, she started to look over the other faces at the pub.  She was hoping to see her close friend Homer, but he was not here.  She took a big swallow, and then looked up.  A man was staring a her;  a very handsome one.  She locked eyes with him, and her heart leapt.  Could it be... was this the one?

He started to make his way towards her, his eyes locked into hers, and it was clear that they were both thinking the same thing.

She nerviously brushed through her hair to fix herself up.  People were always trying to convince her that there was no such thing as ``love at first sight,'' but here she was experiencing it at last!

She continued to stare into his eyes as he approached, and she started to greet him... as he walked straight past her and started talking to the girl behind her.  ``Your eyes... I have never seen anything like them,''  Christina watched him tell the girl, as they gazed at each other, completely oblivious to anything else.  He took her hand and kissed it.  ``It is warm in here.  Would you care to take a walk outside with me to cool off?''  ``I would love to,'' she replied, smiling.  He took her arm, and they left the pub.

Christina slumped.  Not again, she thought to herself.  I mean, honestly, what were the odds that this would happen to her five times in a row?  Was she really naive to think that the guy was actually staring into her eyes, this time?

She felt an arm wrap around her.  ``Hey buddy,'' a man said to her.  ``I saw what happened.  You really have the worst luck with these things.''

She gave Homer a smile -- small, but warm -- as she pressed herself against him for a moment.  The two of them had started their hero training together, and had developed a close friendship over the years.  ``This really isn't my day;  or my month, for that matter,'' she told him.

Homer looked at her with concern.  ``What happened this time?''

``So, I made it all the way into his fortress --- and really, you should have seen me!  He had no less than seven gangs of ninjas waiting for me, each versed in a different martial arts style in the hope that one of them would be able to take me down.  Of course, in his arrogance he gave them nearly all of the keys to his castle so as I took each one down it was easy as pie to make my way around.  And his puzzle chambers... I mean, honestly, who \emph{couldn't} solve the differential equation $dz=\frac{1}{3}x^2\,dx+\frac{1}{3}y^2\,dy$ in their head?  It's basic integration!  And, god, he keeps re-using so many of his crossword clues that I stopped having to even think about half of them...''

``And then,''  Homer asked?

``And then I realized that I had forgotten the stupid lock-pick that I needed to get into his vault.  Honestly, I feel so stupid...''

``You're not stupid, Christina, just a little absent minded is all.''  He took a deep breath.  ``You know, I really didn't want to bring this up, but maybe it is time that you thought about whether this is really the right line of work for you...''

She glared at him.  ``You're right, that is a very bad point for you to bring up.''

Homer continued.  ``Seriously though, Christina.  You are good at so many things.  You fight like a human tornado and you absorb and regurgitate knowledge like a master scholar.  But to be a hero requires more than these things;  you need to have the ability to get \emph{all} of the details right, not merely most of them, and if you can't do that then you are just being a danger to yourself.  There is a reason, after all, that are not allowed to have partners anymore.''

She flushed and pulled away from him.  ``I choose not to have partners because they keep slowing me down and getting in my way!  How can I help if they keep putting themselves in front of my leg when I am in the middle of kicking people?'

``They were trying to help you...''

``Well maybe I don't need any help!'' she shouted at him.  Then she relaxed and slouched.  ``Sorry, I know that you are just trying to help.''

``No, the fault is mine;  I shouldn't have brought it up.  Here, I'll buy you a drink to make it up to you,'' Homer graciously conceded.

She smiled at him.  ``Oh, stop it, you know that I was being unreasonable and are just too nice to say it.  You really treat me too well, you know that?''

He returned the smile.  ``Hey, what other hero can I go picking up guys with?  Oops, another sore point,'' he said as she slouched again.

``Why do the guys always go for the girl next to me, Homer?  Am I really so ugly?''

Homer sighed.  ``Of course not, Christina.  Perhaps it's just that you can come across as being a little, well, intimidating at times?''

``I AM NOT INTIMIDATING!''  she shouted as she slammed her hand onto the bar.  Unfortunately, the hand did not stop at the bar, but made its way all the way through as the bar was split into two pieces.

Homer tried to avoid laughing as Christina blushed.  She sheepishly muttered, ``You know, maybe there is such a thing as doing too many wood breaking drills...  I really need to get myself out of the habit of doing this.''

The bartender walked over and shook his head.  ``I guess I'll be billing this to the Order as well?''

Just what I needed, Christina thought to herself, something else for the boss to chew me out over.  ``Yes,'' she replied.

Homer stood and patted Christina on the back.  ``I think that it's time for us to be going home.''

She sighed, stood, and followed him out the door.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.3:Homer walks her home
Since Homer and Christina lived in the same barracks, they walked home together.  Homer's room was before Christina's in the hallway, but he walked past it to escort her to her door.  She appreciated the gesture, but was embarassed when she opened her door.  I don't just fight like a tornado, she thought to herself, I live like one too.

Homer looked at the mess inside, and then at Christina inquisitively.  ``I was a little hurried packing to leave, so I tore my room apart.''

He smiled, kindly. ``Well then, let's put it back together.''

``Aww, that really isn't neccessary...'' Christina started to protest.  Homer raised his hand.  ``What are friends for?  You've helped me deal with worse, after all,'' he replied entering the room.

She smiled and followed him inside.  They proceeded to pick up the items scattered across the floor and put them away.  Homer picked up a bag on the floor and asked her,  ``Tell me you didn't leave your infinite bag of holding here as well while you were out adventuring?''

She laughed, ``No, thankfully, at least I remembered that.  What you're holding is actually just a bag that I use for shopping that's decorated to look like it.  I would love to use my infinite bag of holding all of the time, but unfortunately as you know it can only hold treasure and not practical items like armor or anything else I'd actually want to buy.  Of course, most of the merchants don't know that so they just assume that I am there to buy a whole lot and give me very good service while I am there.''

``You still buy your own armor?'' Homer asked as he put the bag away in the top drawer.  ``I thought that the Order had just finished redesigning it so that it can fit women now.''

``It's true that the new armor is finally, shall we say, `anatomically correct', but it still lacks style, and if you can't have a little style then what's the point of being a hero?''

``Point,'' Homer chuckled, and the two of them continued to chat the time away as they brought the room back to a state of order.

``Thank you so much for taking care of me tonight, Homer,''  Christina told him warmly as he left the room.

``My pleasure,'' he replied, turning to face her while standing in the doorway.  ``Heck, it is the least I can do after you spent an entire month taking care of me after my ex dumped me.''

She ran up to him and gave him a hug, and then they both went to bed.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.10:Christina walks to meet the boss (Background on the Order)
Christina was not looking forward to meeting her boss, Bill, that morning.

The campus was designed so that the dormitories were on the opposite side from the main hall, where the briefings and other business occured.  There was a reason for this;  it meant that every time a hero walked from the drom to the hall, he or she had to pass through the memorial ground in the center of the campus, and nobody could walk through this ground without being moved and inspired.

The most prominent memorial was the great statue in the middle of the ground of Patrick Smith, the man who lead the First Heroes in overthrowing King George, the infamous last of the kings who had decided that oppressing his subjects was simply more `fun' than serving them.  This, however, was not why he was honored, for many heros had defeated great enemies, but no other had their statue in this ground.  What made Patrick special was that after leading the First Heroes to overthrow the King, in the moment when the people had been willing to crown him their ruler in their stead, he refused the honor and instead created a parliamentary democracy to govern the land.  He and the First Heroes together founded the Order of Heroes, and by his insistence it was deliberately made subservient to the parliament;  on the platform below his statue is carved the calling of the Heroes of the Order:  ``We fight to protect, not to rule.''  His figure is protrayed on one knee, with a sword held high in one hand and a child cradled against him in the other.

If anyone had doubt in the commitment of the Order in carrying out its mission over the last three hundred years, it would be immediately dispelled by the plain stones surrounding the statue -- stones filled with names, hundreds of names, of the heroes who had died in service.  Every time Christina walked past the stones, she would reach out and touch some of the names.  No woman's name appeared on the stones, and in a way she was glad of this;  since she had been the first woman admitted to the order, if a name were to appear on the stones in the near future it would be her own!

She continued quietly on her way to her commander's office, sobered both by the memorial ground and also by thoughts of the briefing she was going to have to give him shortly.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.4:Meeting with the boss
As expected, her commander, Bill, was less than pleased.

``So let me get this straight... you made it all the way into the vault -- something that has eluded many of our best heros and reduced them into ashes -- and then you couldn't go in because you forgot your lock-pick.''

Christina just sat in silence, her head hung low.

Bill shook his head.  ``Listen, Christina, the people don't pay us to go adventuring just for the fun of it!  We are paid to right wrongs, to return the money that was plundered to them by villains.  I don't know how much longer we can support you if you keep this up.''

Shock entered Christina's face.  She was aware of how disappointed Bill had been of her, but this was the first time he brought up firing her.  She looked up,  ``Give me another chance, Bill, I swear to you that this time I will get it right.''

``Happily, as it turns out,'' Bill replied, reaching into his desk, ``I do have another mission for you.  It's a tough one, though, but quite frankly if you can't do it, then nobody can.''

Christina perked up.  ``Thank you for having faith in me, Bill!''

Bill snorted.  ``I am not saying that I think you will be able to pull this off, just that if you can't then it is unlikely that anybody else could have.  For all of your forgetfullness and inability to actually complete missions, you are still the smartest, toughest, and fastest hero we have on the rolls.  And so even though I don't think that you will succeed, I would hate to see us not even try and at least I can be reasonabily confident that you won't get your soul eaten.''

Christina's eyes widened.  ``You don't mean...''

``Yes, Christina, I do.  Although the Soul Eater's magic is powerful enough to let him keep his lair outside this world most of the time, even he cannot prevent it from surfacing from time to time, and our wizards have calculated that it will surface in the middle of the ocean again three days from now, and remain here for twenty-four hours before returning to the Aether.''

``Three days?  That isn't nearly enough time...''

``We have hired the service of a dragoneer to drop you off just at the start of the twenty-four hour window and to pick you up at the end.  That might not seem like a lot of time, but happily the Soul Eater, like every other villain, is in some respects his own worst enemy.  He believes that no one would dare to actually infiltrate his lair during this window, so he has not put up as many traps as you are used to having to deal with --- at least, that is what our latest intelligence is on the subject.''

``How recent is that intelligence?''  Christina asked.

``One hundred years old, dating from the last time he surfaced,''  Bill answered.  ``Should I bother asking you whether you are up for this mission?''

Christina slammed her hand against the desk and declared, ``Of course I am up for it!  The dangers might be great, but the glory shall be greater still -- the infamous Soul Eater is about to meet his match!  And, oh, sorry about your desk...''  she finished sheepily, brushing small pieces of wood from her hand.'

``It's okay,'' Bill sighed, staring at the two pieces of wood where his desk had been.  ``I have finally learned by now to never have a meeting with you using my `good desk', so this was a cheap one made soley for this occasion.''  He turned his eyes towards her and looked sharply.  ``But though we may be well funded, it's not like Order is made of money, Christina.  You would do well to remember that.''

A new man entered the room.  He smiled at Christina.  ``Oh, hey, great to see you again!  How did my universal lock pick work?  Were you able to use it to enter the vault?  I spent a lot of time working on that one.''

``No need to talk about that just now, Marcus, '' Bill replied gruffly.  ``It suffices to say that the adaquateness of your lock-pick was not responsible for the failure of her mission.  Why don't you take her down to the lab to show her the new gadgets you have enchanted for her next mission.''

``Oh, the mision failed?  What happened?  Was it the sleeping pills I gave you?  I tested them on our lab dragon to make sure that the spell was strong enough.  Believe me, he was not to happy about...''

``Marcus!''  Bill shouted.

``Oh, right sir.  Well, let's get going then,'' he said to Christina.  She stood and followed him down to his lab.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.5:Marcus shows Christina the new toys
``You'll love what we have for you this time!'' Marcus told Christina with excitement as they made their to the lab.

Despite being in a horrible mood, Christina couldn't help but smile.  Marcus's enthusiasm never cease to be infectious.

``This mission you are going on had some unusual challenges for us, but happily we solved every one of them!  Ah, here we go,'' he said, as they entered the lab.

Christina gasped.  A large, beautiful cloth stretched before her, with ropes handing from four of the corners.

Marcus grinned at her reaction.  ``Do you like it?  We call it a `fall-breaker'.  The cloth was woven to be very, very light, but thick enough that it actually will trap air under it and allow you to glide to the ground after you jump off the dragon.''

Surprised, Christina asked,  ``I am jumping off the dragon?''

``Oh, Bill hadn't told you that part yet?  Yes, unfortunately the dragon is going to be very spooked by the island and so it won't be able to land you there.  It will bring you in pretty close, and then you will jump off wearing the fall-breaker and glide down to the island.''

``There is no way you are testing that thing on me!''

``Don't worry Christina, it has already been tested.  I jumped off the top of the town clock tower a couple of times with it myself, and the second time I didn't even break any bones!  But enough about the fall-breaker.  You might now be wondering how it is that you are going to get off the island if the dragon will not be landing to pick you up.''

Christina choked.  ``Actually, it hadn't even occured to me to worry about that until you mentioned it.''

Marcus beamed.  ``That is exactly why you should be glad to have genuiuses like us thinking about these things for you!  Look, see this ball here,'' he said, picking up a small ball with a rope attached to it, and holding it before her.  ``Just squeeze this three times, and it will inflate to become gigantic,'' he said.  He squeezed the ball, and as promised it grew until it was larger than Marcus.  It started to float to the ceiling, and he held onto the rope and allowed it to lift him.  ``See?  We call this a `float ball', and it will let you fly back up to the dragon when you are finished!  Umm... except we haven't worked out how to make it gently deflate it yet, so could you catch me when I let go of the rope.''

Christina couldn't help laughing.  ``Of course, Marcus,'' she replied.  She held out her arms and caught him as he returned to the ground.

``Thank you!'' Marcus said, regaining his composure.  ``But this isn't all we have for you.  Now, what is the most annoying problem that heros have after they have defeated their villain?''

Christina was embarassed to reply, ``I actually don't have much practical experience with that, so...''

``Convincing him to order his minions to load up your infinite bag of holding with his treasure!  After all, there is usually so much of it that it would take at least a day to load it all yourself.  Add in the fact that the Death Eater is a creature of the Aether making him very difficult to hurt directly, and it would normally be impossible to convince him to do anything at all for you.''  He paused for dramatic effect.

Christina smiled, and asked, ``But?''

``But since he is made of the ether, we can actually \emph{force} him to work for us by touching him with this stone,'' he answered with enthusiasm, holding a glowing red sphere the size of his palm.  ``This was actually a pet project of mine that I have been working on in my spare time for the last few years;  I never thought I'd get the chance to actually see it in use!''

Christina knew better than to ask, but nervousness got the better of her.  ``And you are sure this works?''

``Of course!  We summoned several spirits of varying strengths and sizes to test it and it worked on all them.''

Christina thought for a moment.  ``Could you mount it on a staff for me?''

``Certainly!  We'll call it your Sceptre of Power,''  Marcus beamed.  ``Anyway, this is all we have for you for his mission.  Here are the operating instructions for all of them,'' he said, handing her several rolls of parchment.  ``And the two rolls on the bottom contain all the details of the mission.''

``Thank you,'' Christina replied sincerely as she took the scrolls.  ``I need to start reading through all this right now, since I will be leaving really soon.''

``Of course.  Let us know how everyone worked!''

``Will do, Marcus,''  Christina said to him as she left the room.

The flight to the island was going to take two days, so Christina had only a single day to get herself ready for the mission.  She started by reading through all of the scrolls several times to make sure she understood how to use the new equipment.  To make sure she was comfortable using it, she managed to get her hands on extras that she spent a couple of hours training with.  She was surprised at how manueverable the `fall-breaker' was;  by tugging on the left and right ropes, she could accurately steer herself to a particular spot on the ground;  just in case, though, she first borrowed many, many bales of hay and set them up over a wide area.

As she was practicing, she could hear the sounds of a crowd cheering in the distance.  It spurned her to work harder to prepare -- the next time a crowd cheered her return, she would be sure that she deserved it!

Eventually she felt comfortable with everything.  The day was almost done, so she made a list of everything she needed and carefully went through it as she packed everything up.  She really wanted to tell Homer where she was going, but he was away that night, so she instead made sure she got an early night's sleep.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.6:Christina mounts her dragon
The next morning, Christina left the barracks and walked over to a nearby field.  She gasped at the incredibly beauty of the creature that stood before her.  She had never had never seen a dragon so close before!  It towered over her, his (or her?) scales glistening in the sun like diamonds.  As she walked over to the dragon, she ran through her mental list.  `Fall-breaker'... check.  Float ball... check.  Sceptre of Power... check.  Universal lock-pick... check.  Raw meat for the crocadiles... check.  Infinite bag of holding... oops!

``Hold on a minute,''  she shouted to the rider, ``I forgot something!''  She raced back to the barracks, opened her top drawer and grabbed her bag, and ran back out.

In this time a crowd had started to gather around the dragon.  At first she smiled, thinking they were there to see her off, when she read the signs:

STOP BURNING OUR MONEY TO FUND YOUR ADVENTURES!

MAKE PEACE WITH OUR ENEMIES, NOT WAR!

THE `ORDER' ONLY BRINGS CHAOS!

Oh, god, not pacifists.  She pushed her way through them as they shouted at her.  ``It's no wonder that our enemies pillage us with the way you heros treat them!''

Christina had enough.  She turned to face the crowd, and shouted ``Do you have any idea who it is I am about to fight?  No one less than the Soul Eater himself!  Do you know what he does?  He comes to the Earth and steals peoples souls as well as his treasure in order to feed his belly as well as his averace.''

``Maybe he would stop picking on us if you heros stopped bothering him!''

Christina groaned.  ``We haven't ever pulled off a successful attack on him...''

``Yeah, but you keep trying!''

``Yes, but keep in mind,''  Christina shouted back, ``that this is the SOUL EATER.  He needs to feed on souls in order to live.  Even if he stopped bothering us, he has \emph{farms} where he raises \emph{human beings} to feed his unearthly hunger!  The least we can do is cause him a little pain in return.''

``His internal affairs are not our problem!''

Christina flushed with rage, and was about to say more when the dragoneer called to her, ``Come on!  We barely have enough daylight to make it our next stop as it is.''  She took a deep breath, tuned around, and started to climb onto the dragon's back.

``Besides, how do we know that he even likes eating souls?''  someone shouted.  ``For all we know, he hates eating souls and just does it to live!  Does living according to his nature give us the right to attack him?''

``If it turns out that he gets a stomach ache every time he eats a soul, I will absolutely collapse into tears,'' replied Christina sarcastically;  many of the crowd laughed in response as the dragon took to flight.

%@+node:gcross.20081101130025.7:Flying; conversation with a dragon
As the dragon took off into the air, Christina marveled at the sight below her.  She was incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to travel this way;  dragons were so expensive that only the very rich could afford to use them.

A few moments later, she had a second revelation:  she absolutely hated flying!  It was like experiencing the discomfort of horse-riding and the sickness of sailing at the same time.  She closed her eyes in the hope that this would make it better, and when it failed to do so she unloaded her breakfast to the ground below.  She was grateful that at least the dragoneer hadn't seemed to notice, since the rush of wind at the speeds at which they were travelling made it impossible to hear anything.  She sighed, and held one.

Eight agonizing hours later, they arrived at their destination, the town of Leighover.  Flights very frequently made stops here, so there was a landing area prepared for the dragon, complete with several cows for snacks.  The dragon landed in the middle of a field, allowed the pilot and his passenger off, and then immediately started chowing down on the cows.  Christina and the dragoneer made their way to the inn, where Christina -- who was starving, as she was not able to eat anything while flying -- ate nearly as much as the dragon, and then collapsed into bed.  Who would have thought that flying could be so exhausting?

The next day was much the same;  she didn't feel as bad this time, though -- perhaps she was starting to get used to it.

They made it all the way to the coast.  To keep them as close as possible to the next day's destination, they had to land south from the closest major city, which meant that this night they would be camping.  They landed, and the dragon flew off to forage for the night's dinner, as the dragoneer and Christina prepared set up camp and prepared dinner for themselves from their packed supplies.

``I am surprised that you can trust it to return to us,''  Christina remarked to the dragoneer.  This was actually the first time that Christina had a chance to actually talk to the dragoneer;  in the air it was too noisy for more than the occasionally shouted update on their current progress, and the previous night she had been too famished and exhausted to have more than a token conversation with him.

``First of all, the dragon is not an `it';  his name is Arthur,'' the dragoneer replied.  ''Second, of course he will return!  If he doesn't take us to our destination, then he won't get paid.''

Christina was surprised by this information.  ``It... he... get's paid?''

``Of course he gets paid!  Do you think he would do this for free?''

Christina was not sure how to respond to this, so she replied, ``Well, umm, I didn't...''

The dragoneer shook his head.  ``I bet you though that Arthur was a pack animal, didn't you?''   He snorted.  ``Hmph!  Heros -- so educated, and yet so ignorant.  So few people have interactions with dragons that they are often misunderstood, and rather than combatting this the Order actually encourages it by training its heros to think of dragons as nothing more than  large, blood-thirsty beasts.  After all, it wouldn't be suit them for you heros to give any second thought to killing them, now would it?''  The dragoneer took another bite of his meal, and then continued,  ``So, to answer your unspoken question, yes, Arthur is every bit as intelligence as you and I.  In fact, he is probably more intelligent, given that he is doing this passenger duty in order to pay for tuition for his doctoral program.''

``If dragons are so intelligent and scholarly, then why do they have an odd tendacy to end up as blood-thirsty guardians of the fortress of evil villains!''

The dragoneer shrugged.  ``Dragons are like people;  they aren't all alike.''

Christina pondered this for a moment, and then asked, ``What is Arthur studying?''

``Since you ask, he is going for his doctorate in Villain Studies studies,''  the dragoneer replied.  ``Part of the reason why he took this mission was because it would give him the chance to see an evil villain's lair close up -- though he is not stupid enough to actually want to \emph{land} on the island, since his soul would be in as much danger as yours.''  The pilot paused to take another bite.  ``Speaking of which, why on Earth are you going through with this mission, anyway?  It's not like we can do anything to actually hurt the Soul Eater.''

``Because doing something is better than nothing!'' Christina declared.

``Typical hero,'' the dragoneer replied, as he turned away to focus on his meal.

Christina wondered about what the pilot had told her.  She had killed a few dragons herself and hadn't had a second thought about it.  Were they really as intelligent as the pilot claimed?

As the sunlight died away, Arthur returned.  Christina saw him lift a sack from the cargo pouch.  He opened it, carefully remove a large book from it, and set it by the fire.  He then took out the largest pair of spectacles Christina had ever seen, put them on, and started read his book by the fire.

Well, I suppose that answers that question, she thought to herself.  ``Arthur?'' she asked him.  Arthur ignored her.  She whispered to the dragoneer, ``Can he talk?''

He snorted.  ``Of course he can talk!  Dragons could talk since before you and I were apes.  It's just that they tend to be very reticent, especially a scholarly bookwarm like Arthur.''

Christina tried a different approach.  If dragon academics were anything like human academics, they loved nothing more than to talk about what they knew.  So she asked, ``So, Arthur, what have you learned in your studies of villains?  Have you learned anything about the Soul Eater?''

This got Arthur's attention;  he placed his book on the ground and turned to look at her.  ``Many things I have learned,'' Arthur replied.  His voice was a very low bass, deep enough to for Christina to feel through her entire body, and at the same time so quiet that it was barely a whipser above the crackle of the fire.  ``What I have found to be most remarkable the variety of motivations that drive villains;  they are far more complicated than many people realize.  Many are motivated primarily by averice, and wear a mask of evil to intimidate rather than as a part of their identity.  At the other end of the spectrum, many do not care about riches at all, but simply delight in spreading suffering and misery.  The Incindor, for example, loves lighting villages on fire just to see them burn;  since this makes them difficult to pillage, however, he is among the poorest of villains.  Some, villains, such as Lord Voldemort, have a personal vendetta that they are pursuing, which is often not entirely unjustified.  Then there are those, such as the Soul Eater, who act purely in response to perceived provocation---''

``Hold on there!'' Christina interrupted.  ``The Soul Eater eats souls.  That is his nature;  provocation has nothing to do with it!''

``The Soul Eater has his own soul farm and cares little for riches.  What he hates, however, is having the sanctity of his home violated every hundred years, and every time it happens he terrorizes the land of the living in retaliation.''

``It is completely naive to think that if we stopped raiding his fortress, that he would just suddenly give up tormenting us!''

``Believe me, the Soul Eater has been studied very thoroughly -- at least, as much as possible given the paucity of the data -- and this is the conclusion that has been reached by the experts.  But anyway, I have my studies to attend to.''  He picked up his book.

``Then you are a hypocrit!'' Christina exclaimed.  ``If you really believe that it is raiding his fortress that causes him to terrorize us, then why did you agree to take me there?''

``For three reasons,'' Arthur replied.  ``First and most importantly, the Soul Eater has always fascinated me and I am incredibly fortunate to have been given an opportunity to actually get paid while getting the chance to see his island fortress with my own eyes!  Second, the pay for this mission is very, very good given the hazard.  And thirdly, it will not be a \emph{dragon} that raises his ire, so \emph{we} will not be the ones who feel his wrath.  Why not profit from your foolishness?''  Christina then learned that it was possible for a dragon to smirk, as Arthur returned to his book.

Christina snorted to herself.  Academics -- always inevitable so naive when it comes to the dangers of the world!  As if the Soul Eater would suddenly stop picking on mankind after hundreds of years or terror just because we chose not to harass him back once a century.  What gave these academics the right to think such a silly thing, based on what they themselves admit are a `paucity of data'!  And to believe that people say that the Order is a waste of money.

On the other hand, it was a little disturbing that even the encyclopedia that the Order provided for its heros (to prepare for the inevitable challenges of wit) failed to mention that dragons were intelligent, thoughtful being.  She was fortunate that this had never come up on a mission before in her years as a hero, but it was still disturbing.  She would have to bring it up with Bill when she got back.

Ah well, tomorrow was promising to be a long day, so she had best get some rest.
